# Replacing the Low Voltage Lead-Acid Battery

This procedure is intended for vehicles in North America only.

CAUTION: To avoid damage that is not covered by the warranty, replace your low voltage lead-acid battery with the same type of battery. The low voltage lead-acid battery for North American vehicles is AtlasBX / Hankook 85B24LS 12V 45Ah. You can purchase a new lead-acid low voltage battery that is compatible with your vehicle from your local service center

Note: Vehicles manufactured between approximately July 2017 and October 2020 do not have a heat pump and should use Vehicles Manufactured Before Approximately October 2020. Vehicles manufactured afterward have a heat pump and should use Vehicles Manufactured After Approximately October 2020.

Perform the following procedure to replace the lead-acid low voltage battery. Wear appropriate personal protection equipment (such as safety glasses, leather gloves when handling the lead-acid battery etc.).


## Vehicles Manufactured Before Approximately October 2020

Removal:
1. Prepare the vehicle to remove the low voltage lead-acid battery:
- Ensure the vehicle is in Park.
- Lower all windows.
- Open the front trunk.
- Leave a door propped open so you can get back into the vehicle if needed.
- Disconnect the charge cable from the charge port.
2. Move the driver and front passenger seat fully forward.
3. Under the rear seat, press the left and right tabs to the side and lift the seat cushion up. The seat separates from the base but is still restrained by one wire harness on each side.
4. Disconnect the wire harnesses and remove the seat cushion. Set the cushion aside.
5. In the front trunk, remove the vehicle’s underhood apron by inserting a small, non-marring flat tool or your fingers underneath the panel. Pull up to loosen the clips and set the underhood apron aside.
6. Remove the cabin intake duct and set it aside.
7. Power off the vehicle by navigating to Controls > Safety > Power Off on the touchscreen.
8. With a 10mm socket, loosen the nut that secures the negative (-) terminal clamp to the negative (-) post on the low voltage lead-acid battery. Release the terminal clamp from the negative (-) post.
9. Disconnect the low voltage cable from penthouse:
- In the rear passenger seat, remove the foam cover and set it aside. The foam covers the low voltage cable.
- Release and pull down the gray lever-arm on the side of the low voltage connector.
- Pull the connector upward to disconnect it from the penthouse.
Warning: The area under the seat cushion houses the high voltage Battery. DO NOT TOUCH OR PLACE ITEMS ON THE METAL HOUSING! Doing so can cause serious damage or injury.
10. With a 10mm socket, release the terminal cover and loosen the nut that secures the positive (+) terminal clamp to the positive (+) post on the low voltage lead-acid battery. Release the terminal clamp from the positive (+) post and cover the terminal clamp with a dry rag.
CAUTION: Do not allow the positive (+) terminal clamp to contact nearby components like the low voltage battery hold down bracket or A/C cooling lines.
11. Unplug the vent tube hose from the negative (-) terminal side of the low voltage lead-acid battery.
12. With a 10mm socket, loosen the nut and release the battery hold down from the top of the low voltage lead-acid battery by unhooking and sliding it back, taking care to ensure it does not slip into the vehicle.
13. Using the battery handle, carefully remove the low voltage lead-acid battery, taking care not to touch or damage the surrounding components.
Warning: When lifting the low voltage lead-acid battery, stand in front of the vehicle and use proper lifting technique. The low voltage battery weighs approximately 25 lb (12 kg). Failure to do so may cause serious injury.
14. Inspect the new low voltage lead-acid battery to ensure it is equipped a red plug on the positive (+) terminal side. If the new low voltage battery does not have a red plug, use a small trim tool transfer the red plug from the old battery to the new one.
CAUTION: Dispose of the old low voltage lead-acid battery according to local laws, such as dropping it off at a battery recycling facility. Keep the low voltage battery upright and place it on a towel or piece of cardboard when transporting it.

Installation:
1. Remove the protective caps from the positive (+) and negative (-) posts on new low voltage lead-acid battery.
2. Carefully maneuver the new low voltage battery into place, taking care not to touch or damage nearby components.
3. Install the low voltage battery hold down and use a 10mm socket to tighten the bolt that secures it to the low voltage lead-acid battery. Torque the bolt to 6 Nm (4.4 ft-lb).
4. In the rear passenger seat, connect the penthouse cable to the connector:
- Ensure the gray lever-arm is down, then install the connector.
- Secure the connector by gently tugging the gray lever-arm upward until it clicks into place.
- Replace the foam cover on top of the penthouse cable.
Warning: The area under the seat cushion houses the high voltage Battery. DO NOT TOUCH OR PLACE ITEMS ON THE METAL HOUSING! Doing so can cause serious damage or injury.
5. Connect the positive (+) terminal by positioning the terminal clamp over the terminal post. Using a 10mm socket, torque the nut to 6 Nm (4.4 ft-lb). Install the positive (+) terminal cover.
6. Connect the negative (-) terminal by positioning the terminal clamp over the connector. Using a 10mm socket, torque the nut to 6 Nm (4.4 ft-lb).
7. Connect the vent tube hose into the negative (-) terminal side of the low voltage lead-acid battery.
8. Replace the cabin intake duct.
9. Open one of the vehicle’s doors to make sure power has been correctly restored and the touchscreen turns on (this may take several minutes).
10. In the rear seat, connect the seat wire harnesses (one on each side) and replace the seat cushion.
11. Press the seat cushion back into the base until it clicks into place.
12. Replace the underhood apron by aligning the clips into their openings in the front trunk. Press down to lock them in place. The clips make an audible clicking sound when secured.
13. Close the front trunk. If an alert to replace to low voltage lead-acid battery was previously shown on the touchscreen, ensure the alert no longer appears.


## Vehicles Manufactured After Approximately October 2020
