# Vehicle Loading

## Vehicle Labeling

It is important to understand your vehicle's original tire sizes and pressures, and the GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) and GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating). This information can be found on two labels attached to Model 3.

Both labels are visible on the door pillar when the front door is open.

Note: If your Model 3 is fitted with Tesla accessory wheels or tires, your Model 3 may include an additional label indicating that values may differ from what is stated on the label. If this is the case, see Accessory Wheels and Tires.

Two labels on center door pillar indicating how much weight the vehicle can carry:
1. Tire and Loading Information Label
2. Vehicle Certification Label

Warning: Overloading Model 3 has an adverse effect on braking and handling, which can compromise your safety or cause damage.

CAUTION: Never store large amounts of liquid in Model 3. A significant spill can cause electrical components to malfunction.


## Tire and Loading Information Label

The Tire and Loading Information label provides:
- The maximum number of occupant seating positions.
- The maximum vehicle capacity weight.
- The size of the original tires.
- The cold inflation pressures for the original front and rear tires. These pressures are recommended to optimize ride and handling characteristics.

Never change this label, even if you use different tires in the future.

Note: If Model 3 is loaded to its full capacity, double check all tires to ensure they are inflated to their recommended pressure levels.


## Vehicle Certification Label

The Vehicle Certification label provides:
- GVWR - Gross Vehicle Weight Rating. The maximum allowable total mass of Model 3. This is calculated as the weight of Model 3 equipped with the heaviest factory selectable options, all passengers, fluids, and cargo.
- GAWR FRT and GAWR RR - Gross Axle Weight Rating for the front and rear axles. The GAWR is the maximum distributed weight that each axle can support.

CAUTION:To prevent damage, never load Model 3 so that it is heavier than GVWR or exceeds the individual GAWR weights.


## Towing a Trailer

Warning: Do not use Model 3 for towing purposes. Model 3 does not currently support towing. Towing can cause damage and increase the risk of a collision.

CAUTION: Using Model 3 for towing without Tesla-approved towing components and accessories may void the warranty.


## Roof Racks

Model 3 supports the use of Tesla-approved roof racks using a Tesla mounting accessory. To install roof racks, you must use this accessory and you must use only roof rack systems that have been approved by Tesla (see Parts and Accessories). Failure to do so can cause significant damage.


## Calculating Load Limits

1. Locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX lbs or XXX kg” on the “Tire and Loading Information” label.
2. Determine the combined weight of all occupants that will ride in the vehicle.
3. Subtract the combined weight of the occupants from XXX lbs or XXX kg (see Step 1).
4. The resulting figure equals the available cargo load capacity. For example, if the “XXX” amount equals 1400 lbs (635 kg) and there will be five 150 lb (68 kg) passengers in the vehicle, the amount of available cargo capacity is 650 lbs (1400 ‑ 750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs) or 295 kg (635 ‑ 340 (5 x 68) = 295 kg).
5. Determine the combined cargo weight being loaded on the vehicle. That weight must not exceed the available cargo load capacity calculated in Step 4.

Warning: Trunks are the preferred places to carry objects. In a collision, or during hard braking and sharp turns, loose items in the cabin could injure occupants.

### Example Load Limit Calculations

How much cargo Model 3 can carry depends on the number and weight of passengers. The following calculated load limit examples assume passengers weigh 150 lbs (68 kg). If passengers weigh more or less, available cargo weight decreases or increases respectively.

#### Table 1. Driver and one passenger

|Description|Total|
|--------|--------|
|Vehicle capacity weight|954 lbs (433 kg)|
|Subtract occupant weight (2 x 150 lbs/68 kg)|300 lbs (136 kg)|
|Available cargo weight|654 lbs (297 kg)|

#### Table 2. Driver and four passengers

|Description|Total|
|--------|--------|
|Vehicle capacity weight|954 lbs (433 kg)|
|Subtract occupant weight (5 x 150 lbs/68 kg)|750 lbs (340 kg)|
|Available cargo weight|204 lbs (93 kg)|

When carrying cargo, distribute the weight as evenly as possible between the front and rear trunks. For maximum load limits specific to the trunks, see Front Trunk Load Limit and Rear Trunk Load Limits.
