# Full Self-Driving (Beta)

Note: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Full Self Driving (Beta) (also referred to as Autosteer on City Streets), or the feature may not operate exactly as described.

When Full Self-Driving (Beta) (also referred to as Autosteer on City Streets) is engaged, Model 3 attempts to drive to your destination by following curves in the road, stopping at and negotiating intersections, making left and right turns, navigating roundabouts, and entering/exiting highways.

Unlike Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, and Navigate on Autopilot, which are intended for use on multi-lane roadways with clear lane markings, Full Self-Driving (Beta) is meant to work in a variety of driving scenarios. You can use Full Self-Driving (Beta) on any type of roadway, including residential and city streets.

Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make Model 3 autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, you must monitor your surroundings and other road users at all times.

Driver intervention may be required in certain situations, such as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going through complex intersections. For more examples of scenarios in which driver intervention might be required, see Limitations and Warnings.

Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses inputs from cameras mounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Model 3 to build a model of the area surrounding Model 3 (see Cameras). The Full Self-Driving computer installed in Model 3 is designed to use this input, rapidly process neural networks, and make decisions to safely guide you to your destination.

Note: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a beta feature. As Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Beta) capabilities evolve, Model 3 is upgraded through over-the-air software updates. Download updates as soon as they become available.

Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Beta) requires a fully attentive driver and will display a series of escalating warnings requiring driver response. You must keep your hands on the steering wheel while Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged. In addition, the cabin camera monitors driver attentiveness (see Cabin Camera).

Use Full Self-Driving (Beta) in limited Beta only if you will pay constant attention to the road and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings.

CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside of the United States and Canada. Because every country contains unique infrastructure, driving behaviors, and traffic patterns that Full Self-Driving (Beta) must adapt to over time, it is essential for drivers using Full Self-Driving (Beta) in newly eligible countries to be extra attentive and overly cautious. You must be ready to take over safely at any time.

Warning: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a hands-on feature that requires you to pay attention to the road at all times. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, pay attention to pedestrians and cyclists, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Beta) and the situations in which it may not work as expected. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings.


## Before Using Full Self-Driving (Beta)

Before using Full Self-Driving (Beta), you must:
- Ensure that forward-facing cameras are unobstructed and calibrated (see Cameras). Full Self-Driving (Beta) depends on the ability of the cameras to detect traffic lights, stop signs, and road markings.
- Ensure that the latest version of maps has been downloaded to Model 3. Although Full Self-Driving (Beta) primarily uses visual data received from the vehicle's cameras, greater accuracy is achieved when using the most recent map data. To check which version of maps is currently downloaded, touch Controls > Software. You must connect to a Wi-Fi network to receive updated maps (see Map Updates).

In addition, you must enable Full Self-Driving (Beta) before you can use it. To enable Full Self-Driving (Beta), touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Features > Full Self-Driving (Beta) and then, after carefully reading and understanding the popup window, touch Yes.

Note: When Full Self-Driving (Beta) is enabled, Autosteer and Navigate on Autopilot are automatically disabled. In situations where you would use Autosteer and Navigate on Autopilot, such as on a controlled-access, multi-lane highway, activate Full Self-Driving (Beta) the same way you would Autosteer.

If desired, change the setting for Full Self-Driving (Beta) Profile from the default setting of Average to Chill or Assertive. Chill provides a more relaxed driving style and Assertive drives with more urgency.


## To Use Full Self-Driving (Beta)

Once Full Self-Driving (Beta) is enabled, activate it the same way you would Autosteer (see Autosteer).
1. Enter a destination. If you do not choose a destination, Model 3 chooses the most probable driving path or suggests a destination based on your driving.
2. When the touchscreen displays the gray steering wheel icon, move the drive stalk fully down twice in quick succession.

You can engage Full Self-Driving (Beta) at any speed less than 85 mph (150 km/h), including when Model 3 is at a standstill.

The touchscreen displays the maximum speed in blue. When you engage Full Self-Driving (Beta), the set cruising speed defaults to the speed limit, plus any offset you’ve specified. If Autopilot is unable to determine the speed limit, the cruising speed is your current speed, in addition to any specified offset.

To indicate that Full Self-Driving (Beta) is available but not engaged, the top corner of the touchscreen displays a gray steering wheel icon next to the driving gear.

When Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, the steering wheel icon is blue and a blue line represents your driving path.

When Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, the touchscreen displays a visualization of the environment surrounding Model 3, including the roadway and detected objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, curbs, bicyclists, and more. Objects shown in blue represent priorities that Full Self-Driving (Beta) is actively controlling for at a given time.

Note: The Full Self-Driving (Beta) visualization may not be a holistic representation of the objects, road markings, road signals, and other variables that Full Self-Driving (Beta) takes into account as it attempts to drive to your destination. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, it uses data from the cameras on Model 3 that may not be represented in the visualization (see Cameras).

The visualization will also inform you of the system’s intended action by displaying a message on the touchscreen, such as when the vehicle is slowly creeping for visibility to take a turn at an intersection.

You can widen the visualization area to fullscreen. Enable the setting by touching Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving (Beta) > Expanded Full Self-Driving Visualization. Then on the touchscreen, swipe the visualization window handle to fill the entire screen.

Note: You can override Full-Self Driving (Beta) at any time if you are uncomfortable or uncertain about the system’s intended course of action. You are driving Model 3 at all times.


## Making Turns, Changing Lanes, and Negotiating Intersections

Full Self-Driving (Beta) changes lanes, makes left and right turns, follows on- and off-ramps, and takes forks in the road as necessary to reach the destination. When Full Self-Driving (Beta) makes any such maneuver, the touchscreen displays a message to inform you of the action being taken.

Like Autosteer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Full Self-Driving (Beta) maintains your speed and following distance from the vehicle ahead of Model 3, if there is one. Full Self-Driving (Beta) also slows down and stops at traffic lights and stop signs as necessary, and reacts to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles on the road.

Warning: NEVER make assumptions and predict when and where Full Self-Driving (Beta) will stop or continue through an intersection or road marking. From a driver's perspective, the behavior of Full Self-Driving (Beta) may appear inconsistent. Always pay attention to the roadway and be prepared to take immediate action. It is the driver's responsibility to determine whether to stop or continue through an intersection. Never depend on Full Self-Driving (Beta) to determine when it is safe and/or appropriate to stop or continue through an intersection.

For example, if you are driving on a residential street and another vehicle backs out of a driveway ahead of Model 3, Full Self-Driving (Beta) slows down or stops as appropriate. If the other vehicle stops backing out while partially blocking the driving lane, Full Self-Driving (Beta) slows down and maneuvers around the other vehicle if the width of the lane allows it.

To tell Full Self-Driving (Beta) to change lanes while on a multi-lane roadway, engage the right or left turn signal. On city or residential streets, engaging the right or left turn signal tells Full Self-Driving (Beta) to make a right or left turn, respectively.

Full Self-Driving (Beta) notifies you at the top of the visualization as it takes actions. For example, if Full Self-Driving (Beta) is moving Model 3 into a faster lane, it displays the message Changing lanes into faster lane / Use turn signal to cancel.

Or, if Full Self-Driving (Beta) is changing lanes to follow the navigation route, Changing lanes to follow route / Use turn signal to cancel.

Unlike Navigate on Autopilot, Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not require confirmation before a lane change. To cancel a lane change or turn, cancel the turn signal or intervene with the steering wheel or other vehicle controls.

To be notified by a Chime, Vibration, or Both of upcoming lane changes (in addition to the notification on the touchscreen), touch Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving (Beta) and then select a Lane Change Notification.

Full Self-Driving (Beta) also notifies you when it is slowing down for a stop sign or a traffic light. When the traffic in front of you is slowing down, Full Self-Driving (Beta) shows blue arrows in the driving lane and slows down to maintain an appropriate following distance from the vehicle ahead of you.

Warning: In rare cases, Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not appropriately slow down, come to a stop, or resume control for a stop sign or traffic light. You may assist the system by lightly applying the accelerator, or can override Full Self-Driving (Beta) at any time.


## Changing the Set Speed

While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is active, adjust your settings with the left and right scroll buttons on the steering wheel.
- Roll the right scroll wheel up to increase, or down to decrease, the set speed.
Note: In some cases, your speed is limited by the speed limit or the type of roadway. If this is the case, Full Self-Driving (Beta) displays a message at the top of the visualization.
- Press the steering wheel's right scroll button to the left or right to adjust the Full Self-Driving (Beta) Profile between Chill, Average, and Assertive.

Once you’ve arrived at your destination, Full Self-Driving (Beta) stops Model 3 and displays a message indicating that navigation is complete.


## Driver Attentiveness

Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Beta) requires driver attentiveness. Your hands must be on the steering wheel at all times while Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, and you must monitor your surroundings, the road, and other road users.

Warning: The use of devices designed to circumvent driver attentiveness is a violation of the terms of use for Full Self-Driving (Beta) and may result in the feature being permanently disabled on your vehicle and a ban on future use of the feature.

Full Self-Driving (Beta) displays a message reminding the driver to apply slight force to the steering wheel. If Model 3 does not detect slight turning force on the steering wheel, the touchscreen flashes blue, and eventually chimes repeatedly. Do not use handheld devices while using Full Self-Driving (Beta). If the cabin camera detects a handheld device while Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, the touchscreen displays a message reminding you to keep your hands on the wheel.

Similarly, the cabin camera monitors your continued attentiveness when using Full Self-Driving (Beta). This system cannot be disabled. The touchscreen displays a message reminding you to pay attention if you repeatedly look away from the road, obstruct the camera, or prevent the system from identifying your gaze.

If you repeatedly ignore prompts to apply slight force to the steering wheel or to pay attention, Full Self-Driving (Beta) disables for the rest of the drive and displays the following message requesting you to drive manually. If you don't resume manual steering, Full Self-Driving (Beta) sounds a continuous chime, turns on the warning flashers, and slows the vehicle to a complete stop.

If Full Self-Driving (Beta) repeatedly disengages due to driver attentiveness, your access to Full Self-Driving (Beta) may be suspended.

There may be occasions where driver intervention is required and you must take over immediately to maintain safe driving. Driver-initiated disengagements do not count as improper usage and are expected from the driver.


## Canceling Full Self-Driving (Beta)

To disengage Full Self-Driving (Beta), do any of the following:
- Press the brake pedal.
- Move the drive stalk upward.
CAUTION: If you move the drive stalk upward and hold it up for more than one second, Model 3 shifts into Neutral after canceling Autosteer.
- Take over and steer manually.

When you disengage Full Self-Driving (Beta) by steering manually, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control remains active (see Canceling Autopilot).

In addition, Full Self-Driving (Beta) will disengage if any of the following occurs:
- You shift out of Drive.
- A door or trunk is opened.
- There is an Automatic Emergency Braking event (see Automatic Emergency Braking).
- The driver's seatbelt is released, and/or the driver gets out of their seat.
- You do not respond to repeated reminders to keep your hands on the wheel and subsequent messages on the touchscreen.
- Full Self-Driving (Beta) becomes unavailable. This can happen for a number of reasons (for example, if a camera becomes obscured). If Full Self-Driving (Beta) disengages, an alert will appear on the touchscreen to notify you and a chime will sound. If this happens, take control of steering immediately.

When driver intervention is required, it is best to safely disengage as soon as possible. It is recommended to practice disengaging from Full Self-Driving (Beta) in safe environment without other road users so you may become familiar with the process.
