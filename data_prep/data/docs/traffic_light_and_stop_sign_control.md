# Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

Note: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, or the feature may not operate exactly as described.

Note: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is a BETA feature and works best on roads that are frequently driven by Tesla vehicles. Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control attempts to stop at all traffic lights and may also stop at green lights.

Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs, slowing Model 3 to a stop when using Traffic-Aware cruise control or Autosteer. This feature uses the vehicle's forward-facing cameras, in addition to GPS data, and slows the car for all detected traffic lights, including green, blinking yellow, and off lights in addition to stop signs and some road markings. As Model 3 approaches an intersection, the touchscreen displays a notification indicating the intention to slow down. You must confirm that you want to continue or Model 3 stops at the red line displayed on the touchscreen's driving visualization.

Warning: NEVER make assumptions and predict when and where Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control will stop or continue through an intersection or road marking. From a driver's perspective, the behavior of Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control may appear inconsistent. Always pay attention to the roadway and be prepared to take immediate action. It is the driver's responsibility to determine whether to stop or continue through an intersection. Never depend on Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control to determine when it is safe and/or appropriate to stop or continue through an intersection.


## Before Using

Before using Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, you must:
- Ensure that forward-facing cameras are unobstructed (see Cleaning a Camera) and calibrated (see Drive to Calibrate Cameras). Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control depends on the ability of the cameras to detect traffic lights, stop signs, and road markings.
- Ensure that the latest version of maps has been downloaded to Model 3. Although Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control primarily uses visual data received from the vehicle's cameras, greater accuracy is achieved when using the most recent map data. To check which version of maps is currently downloaded, touch Controls > Software. You must connect to a Wi-Fi network to receive updated maps (see Map Updates).
- Enable the feature. With the vehicle in Park, touch Controls > Autopilot > Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control. Once enabled, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control operates whenever Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer is active.


## How it Works

When Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is enabled and you are using Autosteer, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, or Full Self-Driving (Beta), the touchscreen displays a popup message to inform you that an upcoming traffic light, stop sign, or road marking has been detected. As it approaches the stop location, even at an intersection where the traffic light is green, Model 3 slows down and displays a red line to indicate where Model 3 will stop. To continue through the intersection—even if the traffic light is green —you must press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal to give the vehicle permission to proceed. When you've confirmed that you want to proceed, the red stop line turns gray and Model 3 continues through the intersection and resumes your set cruising speed.

Note: If Model 3 is approaching a green light and detects that a vehicle in front of you is continuing through the intersection, Model 3 continues through the intersection without requiring your confirmation, provided you are not in a turning lane and the vehicle can detect that your hands are on the steering wheel.

Note: If, after you press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that you want to continue through the intersection, the traffic signal changes before you enter the intersection (for example, the light changes from green to yellow or from yellow to red), Model 3 may determine that it is not appropriate to proceed. Therefore, Model 3 stops and you must press the accelerator to proceed. At all times, it is your responsibility to ensure the vehicle stops or accelerates appropriately and safely.

Warning: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control DOES NOT turn Model 3 through an intersection unless Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged. When in a turning lane, Model 3 stops at the red stop line. To proceed, press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal—Model 3 continues straight through the intersection (even when in a turning lane), so you MUST manually steer Model 3 through the intersection (which cancels Autosteer).

Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to operate as described only when the following conditions are met:
- Autosteer, Full Self-Driving (Beta), or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is engaged.
- The cameras can detect an upcoming traffic light, stop sign or road marking (for example, cameras are unobstructed and have a clear line-of-sight to the traffic light, stop sign, or road marking).
- The touchscreen on Model 3 is displaying an upcoming traffic light in "bold" format. Model 3 does not acknowledge traffic lights that the touchscreen shows as faded. If a traffic light is not directly ahead of the camera (for example, it is located at an angle of the camera's view, or located in an adjacent lane) the touchscreen displays it as faded and Model 3 does not slow down and stop for it.

Warning: If the touchscreen is not displaying a red stop line at an upcoming intersection, Model 3 does not slow down or stop. It is the driver's responsibility to pay attention to upcoming intersections and monitor traffic conditions to determine when and if the vehicle should stop and then to take appropriate action as needed.

Warning: Never depend on Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control to determine whether to stop at, or proceed through, an intersection. Drive attentively by watching the road and paying attention to the roadway, upcoming intersections, traffic conditions, crosswalks, and other road users. It is always the driver's responsibility to determine whether to stop or proceed. Be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to do so can result in injury or death.

Warning: In some situations, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control may inaccurately detect a traffic light or stop sign, causing Model 3 to slow down unexpectedly. Be prepared to take immediate action at all times.

Warning: You must press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that you want to proceed through an intersection, regardless of the status of the traffic light. If you do not confirm, Model 3 stops at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen, even if stopping may be inappropriate. Stopping at a green light may confuse other drivers and may result in a collision, injury or death. Therefore, always pay attention to upcoming intersections and be prepared to manually brake or accelerate in response to surroundings.

Warning: Never assume that your ability to see a traffic light, stop sign, or road marking (especially at a complex intersection, or an intersection in which a traffic light or sign is partially obstructed, etc.) means that Model 3 can also see it and respond appropriately.

Warning: Even the most recent map data does not include all traffic lights and stop signs. Therefore, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control relies heavily on the ability of the cameras to detect traffic lights, stop signs, road markings, etc. As a result, Model 3 may ignore an intersection that is blocked from the camera's view (for example, obstructed by a tree or a large vehicle or object, or located near a steep hill or sharp curve).

Warning: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is not a substitute for attentive driving and sound judgment.


## Traffic Lights

When driving with Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control engaged, and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control enabled, Model 3 is designed to respond as follows when approaching intersections controlled by a traffic light:

|Type of Traffic Light|Vehicle Intended Response|
|--------|--------|
|Green traffic light <br><br>Traffic light without lights on|At a solid green traffic light, or at a traffic light that is currently off (not illuminated), Model 3 slows down. <br><br>If you are following a car in front of you that continues through the intersection, the touchscreen displays a green stop line and provided your hands are detected on the steering wheel, Model 3 also continues. If a car is not in front of you, the touchscreen displays a red stop line and you must confirm that you want to continue through the intersection by press down on the drive stalk or briefly pressing the accelerator pedal. If you don’t confirm, Model 3 stops at the red stop line. <br><br>Note: Model 3 resumes the set cruising speed when it continues through the intersection, taking into consideration the speed of a vehicle in front of you.|
|Yellow traffic light <br><br>Red traffic light|Model 3 slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to continue through the intersection (for example, the light turns green again, or once Model 3 has come to a complete stop), you must press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal.|
|Traffic light turning from green to yellow <br><br>Traffic light turning from yellow to red <br><br>Traffic light turning from red to green|Model 3 slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to proceed through the intersection (for example, the light turns green again), you must press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal. <br><br>Note: If the traffic light changes after you've confirmed that you want to proceed (for example, a green traffic light turns yellow), Model 3 may stop instead of continuing, especially if Model 3 determines that it can safely stop before entering the intersection. <br><br>Note: Model 3 is not designed to proceed through an intersection when the traffic light is red or if the light turns yellow in situations when there is adequate distance to safely stop before entering the intersection. <br><br>Note: You can take over driving at any time by manually braking to cancel Autosteer or Traffic-aware Cruise Control.|
|Blinking green traffic light <br><br>Blinking yellow traffic light|Model 3 slows down. To proceed, you must press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal. If you don’t, Model 3 stops at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. <br><br>Note: To prevent Model 3 from stopping, and to minimize how much it slows down as it approaches, you can confirm that you want to proceed by press down on the drive stalk or briefly pressing the accelerator pedal at any time after the touchscreen displays the red stop line. Model 3 resumes your set cruising speed immediately after you confirm (taking into consideration the speed of a vehicle in front of you). <br><br>Warning: Approach attentively and be prepared to press the brake pedal to slow down or stop.|
|Blinking red traffic light|Model 3 slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to proceed through the intersection (for example, traffic laws and conditions indicate it is safe and legal to proceed), you must press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal.|


## Stop Signs and Road Markings

When driving with Autosteer or Traffic-aware Cruise Control engaged, and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control enabled, Model 3 is designed to respond as follows when approaching intersections controlled by stop signs, stop lines, or road markings:

|Type of Intersection|Vehicle Intended Response|
|--------|--------|
|Vehicle approaching a four way intersection and continues straight with right-of way <br><br>No Traffic Control <br><br>Vehicle approaching the straight arm of a T-junction and continues straight with right-of-way <br><br>Arm of T-junction|Model 3 assumes the right of way and continues straight without slowing down or stopping.|
|Vehicle approaching end of the T-junction and slows down to a stop <br><br>End of T-junction|If Model 3 detects a T-junction based on the map data, Model 3 slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to proceed, you must take over steering and acceleration. <br><br>Warning: Model 3 may not stop at a T-junction that does not have a stop sign or stop line, or if the T-junction is not included in the map data. Drive attentively and be prepared to stop (when necessary and/or appropriate).|
|Vehicle approaching a four way intersection and stops at the stop sign <br><br>Stop Sign <br><br>Vehicle approaching a four way intersection and stops at the stop sign and road marking <br><br>Stop Sign and Road Marking <br><br>Vehicle approaching a four way intersection and stops at a road marking <br><br>Road Marking|Model 3 slows down and comes to a complete stop at the red stop line displayed on the touchscreen. When you want to proceed through the intersection, you must press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal. <br><br>Note: If you confirm that you want to proceed through an intersection controlled by a stop sign by press down on the drive stalk or briefly pressing the accelerator pedal before Model 3 has stopped, your confirmation is ignored. Model 3 is not designed to proceed through a stop sign without stopping. <br><br>Note: Even when using Autosteer, and even if you have engaged a turn signal, you must turn the steering wheel yourself (which cancels Autosteer) to complete a turn at an intersection.|

Warning: Model 3 also slows down and stops at a roundabout. You must take over steering (which cancels Autosteer) and press down on the drive stalk or briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that you want to continue through the roundabout.

Warning: At crosswalks, Model 3 may slow down and may stop, depending on whether the crosswalk is controlled by a traffic light and whether the cameras detect pedestrians, bicyclists, etc. in the crosswalk. Pay particular attention at crosswalks and be prepared to take over at any time. Failure to do so can result in injury or death.


## Limitations

Depending on many different circumstances and environmental conditions, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control may or may not stop at:
- Railroad crossings.
- Keep-out zones.
- Toll booths.
- Crosswalk systems.
- Yield signs or temporary traffic lights and stop signs (such as at construction areas).
- Miscellaneous traffic U-turn lights, bicycle and pedestrian crossing lights, lane availability lights, etc.

In addition, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is particularly unlikely to operate as intended, can disengage, or may not operate, when one or more of the following conditions are present:
- Driving through consecutive light-controlled intersections that are very close to each other.
- Visibility is poor (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions are interfering with camera or sensor operation.
- Bright light (such as direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
- A camera is obstructed, covered, damaged, or not properly calibrated.
- Driving on a hill or on a road that has sharp curves on which the cameras are unable to see upcoming traffic lights or stop signs.
- A traffic light, stop sign, or road marking is obstructed (for example, a tree, a large vehicle, etc.).
- Model 3 is being driven very close to a vehicle in front of it, which is blocking the view of a camera.

Warning: The limitations listed above are not an exhaustive list of reasons why Model 3 may not operate as expected. Many unforeseen circumstances can adversely impact the accurate operation of Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control. Using this feature does not reduce or eliminate the need to drive attentively and responsibly. You must be prepared to take appropriate and immediate action at all times.
