# About Autopilot

Autopilot is a suite of advanced driver assistance features that are intended to make driving safer and less stressful. None of these features make Model 3 fully autonomous or replace you as the driver. Autopilot features come standard with all new Tesla vehicles.

Note: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with all features listed below, or a feature may not operate as described.

Basic Autopilot includes Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer.
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control: Maintains your speed and an adjustable following distance from the vehicle in front of you, if there is one (see Traffic-Aware Cruise Control).
- Autosteer: Maintains your speed and distance from a leading vehicle while also intelligently keeping Model 3 in its lane (see Autosteer).

Warning: Basic Autopilot is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and be mindful of road conditions, surrounding traffic, and other road users (such as pedestrians and cyclists). Always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury, or death.

Enhanced Autopilot includes additional features. Enhanced Autopilot Features are designed to further reduce driver workload and make common actions, such as changing lanes or parking, easier.
- Auto Lane Change: Moves Model 3 into an adjacent lane when you engage the turn signal and Autosteer is active (see Auto Lane Change).
- Navigate on Autopilot: Actively guides Model 3 from a highway’s on-ramp to off-ramp, including performing lane changes, navigating interchanges, automatically engaging the turn signal, and taking the correct exit (see Navigate on Autopilot).
- Autopark: Parks Model 3, either parallel or perpendicularly (see Autopark).
Summon: Moves Model 3 forward or backward, even while you’re outside the vehicle. This is useful for parking in tight parking spots (see Summon).
- Smart Summon: Moves Model 3 out of a parking space and through more complex environments, maneuvering around obstacles and other vehicles, to meet you or go to a predetermined target (see Smart Summon).

Warning: 
Enhanced Autopilot is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and be mindful of road conditions, surrounding traffic, and other road users (such as pedestrians and cyclists). Always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death.

Full Self-Driving Capability includes:
- Traffic Light & Stop Sign Control: Maintains your speed, keeps a following distance, and keeps Model 3 in its lane while also slowing down and stopping for traffic lights and stop signs (see Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control).
- Autosteer on City Streets (Full Self-Driving (Beta)): Attempts to drive to your destination by following curves in the road; stopping at and negotiating intersections, stop signs, and roundabouts; making left and right turns; and entering/exiting highways (see Full Self-Driving (Beta)).

Warning: Full Self-Driving Capability is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and be mindful of road conditions, surrounding traffic, and other road users (such as pedestrians and cyclists). Pay attention to the road at all times and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death.

Autopilot uses the cameras on Model 3, which monitor the surrounding area and detect other vehicles, pedestrians, road markings, and obstacles such as barriers and curbs. There are cameras mounted on the front, rear, left, and right sides of Model 3 (see Cameras).

Model 3 may also be equipped with a cabin camera, mounted in the rear-view mirror, that monitors driver attentiveness. It is your responsibility to keep your hands on the wheel, pay attention to the road, and be ready to take immediate action at any time.

When Autopilot is engaged, Model 3 shows a series of escalating warnings reminding you to keep your hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road. If there is no response, Autopilot disengages and is unavailable for the remainder of the drive.

Warning: Autopilot is designed for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a collision warning or avoidance system. It is your responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Never depend on Autopilot to adequately slow down Model 3. Always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.

It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Autopilot and be ready to take control at all times. For more limitations, cautions, and warnings, see Limitations and Warnings.


## Autopilot Conditions

Ensure all cameras are clean before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera). Dirty cameras and and sensors (if equipped), as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Model 3 displays a message on the touchscreen and Autopilot features may not be available.

Before you can use Autopilot features, and after some Service visits, you must drive a short distance to calibrate cameras. For more information, see Drive to Calibrate Cameras.

In addition, these features may not work as intended when:
- The road has sharp curves or significant changes in elevation.
- Road signs and signals are unclear, ambiguous, or poorly maintained.
- Visibility is poor (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
- Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) interferes with the view of the camera(s).

The above list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of Autopilot features. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings.

|Autopilot Feature|Available When|
|--------|--------|
|Traffic-Aware Cruise Control|- You are driving between 18 mph (30 km/h) and 85 mph (140 km/h) <br><br>Note: You can activate Traffic-Aware Cruise Control at lower speeds if there is a vehicle detected at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) ahead of Model 3.|
|Autosteer|- You are driving between 18 mph (30 km/h) and 85 mph (140 km/h) <br><br>Note: You can activate Autosteer at lower speeds if there is a vehicle detected at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) ahead of Model 3. <br><br>Note: On a residential road, a road without a center divider, or a road that is not controlled access, the maximum allowed cruising speed is limited and the touchscreen displays a message. The restricted speed will be the speed limit of the road plus 5 mph (10 km/h). <br><br>- Headlights are set to On or Auto. Although Autopilot is available both during the day and in low light conditions (dusk or dark), Autosteer aborts or is unavailable if headlights are set to Off. When Autosteer is engaged, Auto High Beam is automatically enabled (see High Beam Headlights) and wipers are set to Auto.|
|Navigate on Autopilot|- You are driving between 18 mph (30 km/h) and 85 mph (140 km/h). <br><br>Note: You can activate Navigate on Autopilot at lower speeds if there is a vehicle detected at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) ahead of Model 3. <br><br>- You are driving on a controlled-access highway. When you leave a controlled-access highway, Navigate on Autopilot reverts to Autosteer.|
|Full Self-Driving (Beta)|- You are driving less than 85 mph (150 km/h). <br><br>Note: You can activate Full Self-Driving (Beta) at lower speeds, including when Model 3 is at a standstill, whether or not there is a vehicle detected in front of Model 3. <br><br>- Headlights are set to On or Auto. Although Full Self-Driving (Beta) is available both during the day and in low light conditions (dusk or dark), it aborts or is unavailable if headlights are set to Off. When Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, Auto High Beam is automatically enabled (see High Beam Headlights) and wipers are set to Auto.|
