# Restarting the Touchscreen

You can restart your touchscreen if it is unresponsive or demonstrates unusual behavior.

Warning: Only restart the touchscreen while the vehicle is stopped and in Park. The car status display, safety warnings, backup camera, etc. will not be visible during the restart.

1. Shift into Park.
2. Hold down both scroll buttons on the steering wheel until the touchscreen turns black. Pressing the brake pedal while holding down the scroll buttons does not have any impact and is not required.
3. After a few seconds, the Tesla logo appears. Wait approximately 30 seconds for the touchscreen to restart. If the touchscreen is still unresponsive or demonstrating unusual behavior after a few minutes, try power cycling the vehicle (if possible). See Power Cycling the Vehicle.

Note: Pressing the scroll buttons only restarts the touchscreen. It does not restart any other vehicle component and does not power Model 3 off and on.
