# Charging Instructions

## Opening the Charge Port

The charge port is located on the left side of Model 3, behind a door that is part of the rear tail light assembly. Park Model 3 to ensure that the charge cable easily reaches the charge port.

With Model 3 in Park, press and release the button on the Tesla charge cable to open the charge port door.

You can also open the charge port door using any of these methods:
- On the touchscreen, touch Controls and touch the Charge Port icon (lightning bolt).
- On the touchscreen, navigate to Controls > Charging > Open Charge Port.
- Press the bottom of the charge port door when Model 3 is unlocked.
- On the key fob accessory (sold separately), hold down the rear trunk button for 1-2 seconds.
- Use voice commands to open the charge port door (see Voice Commands). You can also use voice commands to close the charge port door, and begin or stop charging.

Note: The following image is provided for demonstration purposes only. Depending on market region and date of manufacture, your charge port may be slightly different.
vehicle with the charge port opening.

Note: The Tesla "T" lights up when you open the charge port door. If you do not insert a charge cable into the charge port within a few minutes after opening the charge port door, the charge port door closes. If this happens, use the touchscreen to open the charge port door again.

Note: In extremely cold weather or icy conditions, it is possible that your charge port latch may freeze in place. Some vehicles are equipped with a charge port inlet heater that turns on when you turn on the rear defrost in cold weather conditions. You can also thaw ice on the charge port latch by enabling preconditioning using the mobile app. To prevent this from occurring, use the Schedule settings, available on both the charging and climate control screens, to set a departure time and enable preconditioning (see Scheduled Charging and Scheduled Departure).

CAUTION: Do not try to force the charge port door open.


## Plugging In

If desired, use the touchscreen to change the charge limit and the charging current (see Charge Settings).

To charge at a public charging station, plug the appropriate adapter into the vehicle's charging port, and then connect the station's charging connector to the adapter. The most commonly used adapter(s) for each market region are provided. Depending on the charging equipment you are using, you may need to start and stop charging using a control on the charging equipment.

If you are using the Mobile Connector, plug into the power outlet before plugging in Model 3.

Align the connector to the charge port and insert fully. When the connector is properly inserted, charging begins automatically after Model 3:
- Engages a latch that holds the connector in place;
- Shifts into Park (if it was in any other drive mode);
- Heats or cools the Battery, if needed. If the Battery requires heating or cooling, you may notice a delay before charging begins.

Note: Whenever Model 3 is plugged in but not actively charging, it draws energy from the charging equipment instead of using energy stored in the Battery. For example, if you are sitting in Model 3 and using the touchscreen while parked and plugged in, Model 3 draws energy from the charging equipment instead of the Battery. In some cases when Model 3 is plugged in but using very little energy, however, it may draw it directly from the Battery. For example, if you leave Model 3 plugged in for several days without using it, it may gradually draw a small amount of energy directly from the Battery to support vehicle systems. Once the Battery discharges enough, it starts charging to reach the limit again. Depending on when you check, the Battery may not have discharged enough yet to trigger a charge cycle. As a result, it may be slightly under the charge limit even after being plugged in for a long period. This is normal, and Model 3 will start charging again once it has discharged enough. Alternatively, to start a new charge cycle manually, unplug and then plug in Model 3.


CAUTION: The connector end of the charge cable can damage the paint if you drop it onto Model 3.


## Charge Port Light

- WHITE (OR LIGHT BLUE): The charge port door is open. Model 3 is ready to charge and the connector is not inserted, or the charge port latch is unlocked and the connector is ready to be removed.
Note: If equipped with an early generation charge port, the charge port remains unlocked whenever the vehicle is not charging and in a cold ambient temperature below 41° F (5° C). In this situation, the charge port light is white.
- BLUE: The charger is connected, but Model 3 is not charging (such as when scheduled charging is active).
- BLINKING BLUE: Model 3 is communicating with the charger, but has not started charging yet (such as when your vehicle is preparing to charge).
- BLINKING GREEN: Charging is in progress. As Model 3 approaches a full charge, the frequency of the blinking slows.
- SOLID GREEN: Charging is complete.
- SOLID AMBER: The connector is not fully plugged in. Realign the connector to the charge port and insert fully.
- BLINKING AMBER: Model 3 is charging at a reduced current (AC charging only).
- RED: A fault is detected and charging has stopped. Check the touchscreen for an alert.


## Charging Status

Charging status displays at the top of the car status screen when the charge port door is open.
1. Time remaining: The estimated time remaining to charge to your set limit (see Charge Settings).
Note: When charging to 100%, the vehicle may continue to charge with low power when charging is displayed as complete. This is expected operation. Because the added energy beyond this point is low, it is usually not beneficial to continue charging.
2. Charging: The current power of the charger.
3. Charging rate: The maximum current available from the attached charge cable.
4. Range gained: Estimated increase in driving distance achieved in the charging session.
5. Driving distance: Displays the total estimated driving distance or energy percentage (depending on your display setting) available.
Note
To change how energy units are displayed, touch Controls > Display > Energy Display.
6. Charge status: Charge status messages (such as Supercharging, Scheduled Charging) display here (see Scheduled Charging and Scheduled Departure).


## During Charging

During charging, the charge port light (the Tesla "T" logo) pulses green, and the touchscreen displays real-time charging status. The frequency at which the green charge port light pulses slows down as the charge level approaches full. When charging is complete, the light stops pulsing and is solid green.

Note: If Model 3 is locked, the charge port light does not light up.

If the charge port light turns red while charging, a fault is detected. Check the touchscreen for an alert describing the fault. A fault can occur due to something as common as a power outage. If a power outage occurs, charging resumes automatically when power is restored.

Note: The thermal system may produce steam under certain conditions if your vehicle is equipped with a heat pump (to determine if your vehicle has a heat pump, touch Controls > Software > Additional Vehicle Information). For example, odorless steam can come from the front of your vehicle while charging at a Supercharger in cold temperature. This is normal and not a cause for concern.

Note: It is normal to hear sounds during charging. Particularly at high currents, the refrigerant compressor and fan operate as needed to keep the Battery cool.

Note: Air conditioning performance is generally not affected by charging. However, in some circumstances (for example, charging at high currents during a particularly warm day), the air coming from the vents may not be as cool as expected and a message displays on the touchscreen. This is normal and ensures that the Battery stays within an optimum temperature range while charging to support longevity and optimum performance.

Warning: Never spray liquid at a high velocity (for example, a pressure washer) towards the charge port while charging. Doing so can result in serious injury or damage to the vehicle, charging equipment, or property.


## Stopping Charging

Stop charging at any time by disconnecting the charge cable or touching Stop Charging on the touchscreen.

Note: To prevent unauthorized unplugging of the charge cable, the charge cable latch remains locked and Model 3 must be unlocked or able to recognize your authenticated phone before you can disconnect the charge cable.

Note: If equipped with an early generation charge port, the charge port remains unlocked whenever the vehicle is not charging and in a cold ambient temperature below 41° F (5° C), even when Model 3 is locked.

To disconnect the charge cable:
1. Press and hold the button on the connector handle to release the latch.
Note
You can also release the latch using the lightning icon on the car status overview on the touchscreen or mobile app, or by pressing and holding the rear trunk button on the key fob.
2. Pull the connector from the charge port. The charge port door automatically closes.

To disconnect the charge cable when using an adapter at a public charge station:
1. Unlock Model 3.
2. While holding the public charging handle in one hand and the adapter in the other hand, press and hold the button on the public charging handle and pull both outwards, removing the handle and adapter at the same time.
Note
If the charging station handle separates from the adapter, leaving the adapter in Model 3, use the touchscreen to unlock the charge port.
3. Press and hold the button on the charging handle again to release the adapter from the public charging handle.

Note: The charge port door automatically closes within approximately 10 seconds of removing the connector from the charge port.

CAUTION: Tesla strongly recommends leaving Model 3 plugged in when not in use. This maintains the Battery at the optimum level of charge.


## Charge Settings

Access charge settings by touching Controls > Charging when Model 3 is in Park. You can also touch the battery icon on the touchscreen to access charge settings.
1. Driving distance: Displays the total estimated driving distance available.
2. Set limit: Adjust the charge slider to the level of charging you want. The setting you choose applies to immediate and scheduled charging sessions.

Note: Refer to the information on the vehicle touchscreen (navigate to Controls > Charging) or the mobile App (touch the Charging icon) for recommended daily and trip charging limits.

Note: A portion of the battery image may appear blue. This indicates that a small portion of the energy stored in the battery is not available because the battery is cold. This is normal and no reason for concern. When the battery warms up, the blue portion no longer displays.

You can further adjust charge settings:
- Charge current at this location: The current automatically sets to the maximum current available from the attached charge cable, unless it was previously reduced to a lower level. If needed, touch - or + to change the current (for example, you may want to reduce the current if you are concerned about overloading a domestic wiring circuit shared by other equipment). It is not possible to set the charging current to a level that exceeds the maximum available from the attached charge cable. When you change the current, Model 3 remembers the location. If you charge at the same location, you do not need to change it again. When charging using the Mobile Connector with domestic outlets, your vehicle may automatically select a default charge current. Override this default current to a higher setting by customizing Charge Current at this location or through the mobile app.
- Open Charge Port, Unlock Charge Port and Stop Charging: When not charging, touch Open Charge Port or Unlock Charge Port to open the charge port door or to unlock the charge cable from the charge port. You can also touch the lightning icon near the charge port on the car status overview. Use Stop Charging when you are finished charging.
Note: In cold ambient temperatures below 41° F (5° C), the charge port (if equipped with early generation charge port hardware) remains unlocked whenever the vehicle is not charging.
- Schedule: Depending on the setting you select by touching Switch to Scheduled Departure/Scheduled Charging, this displays either a departure time for when the vehicle should be preconditioned and/or charged by or a time to start charging (see Scheduled Charging and Scheduled Departure).
- Charge on Solar at this location: Through the Tesla mobile app, setup your vehicle with your Tesla Powerwall to charge from excess solar production. When your vehicle is plugged in at home and Charge on Solar is enabled, your vehicle charges up to the minimum charge limit from any source and then continues charging on only excess solar power up to the maximum charge limit. If Scheduled Charging or Scheduled Departure is configured, your vehicle uses any excess solar and waits until the designated time to charge from any source to the minimum charge limit. System requirements: Vehicle software 2023.26 or higher, Powerwall software 23.12.10 or higher and Tesla mobile app 4.22.5 or higher.
- Supercharging: Displays supercharger usage fees, the location, the time that charging started, and a cost estimate for the session (see Supercharger Usage Fees and Idle Fees).
Note: To reduce congestion at high-usage supercharger sites, you may be limited to a maximum charge of 80% when not using Trip Planner (if available in your market region). See Trip Planner.


## Supercharger Usage Fees and Idle Fees

When charging at a Tesla supercharger, information about the charging session displays at the bottom of the charging screen. This includes the location, the time that charging started, and a cost estimate for the session. When you stop supercharging, the estimated cost of the session displays until a new supercharging session begins.

Note: Estimated cost may not reflect the final cost of the supercharging session. Final pricing for supercharging sessions can be found in your Tesla account.

When charging at a Tesla supercharger, you are subject to idle fees. Idle fees are designed to encourage drivers to move their vehicle from the Supercharger when charging is complete. Idle fees are in effect only when half or more of the Superchargers at a site are occupied. The Tesla mobile app notifies you when charging is almost complete, and again when charging is complete. Additional notifications are sent if idle fees are incurred. Idle fees are waived if you move your vehicle within five minutes of when charging completed.

Log into your Tesla account to view fees and details about Supercharger sessions, set up a payment method, and make payments. Once a payment method is saved, fees are automatically paid from your account.


## Charging Best Practices

- Avoid allowing the Battery to get too low (the Battery icon turns yellow when the capacity remaining in the Battery drops to 20% or below).
- Refer to the information on the vehicle touchscreen (navigate to Controls > Charging) or the mobile App (touch the Charging icon) for recommended daily and trip charging limits.


## Manually Releasing Charge Cable

If the usual methods for releasing a charge cable from the charge port (using the charge handle release button, touchscreen, or mobile app) do not work, try pressing and holding down the rear trunk button on the key fob accessory (if equipped) for 1-2 seconds. If it still doesn't release, carefully follow these steps:
1. Ensure that Model 3 is not actively charging by displaying the charging screen on the touchscreen. If necessary, touch Stop Charging.
2. Open the rear trunk.
3. Pull the charge port's release cable downwards to unlatch the charge cable.
Warning: Do not pull the release cable while simultaneously attempting to remove the charge cable from the charge port. Always pull the release cable before attempting to remove the charge cable. Failure to follow these instructions can result in electric shock and serious injury.
release cable with an arrow pointing down.
Note: The release cable may be recessed within the opening of the trim.
4. Pull the charge cable from the charge port.

CAUTION: Use the release cable only in situations where you can not release the charge cable using the usual methods. Continuous use can damage the release cable or charging equipment.

Warning: Do not perform this procedure when your vehicle is charging, or if any orange high voltage conductors are exposed. Failure to follow these instructions can result in electric shock and serious injury or damage to the vehicle. If you are uncertain as to how to safely perform this procedure, contact your nearest Service Center.
