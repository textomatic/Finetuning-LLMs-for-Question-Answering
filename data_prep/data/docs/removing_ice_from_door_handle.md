# Removing Ice From Door Handle

In severe winter conditions, ice buildup within the door handle can prevent the door handle from opening. The process for freeing a Model 3 door handle is slightly different than others to remove ice buildup.

Note: Preemptively applying WD-40 to the door handle pivot pins can help prevent ice buildup inside your door handle.

CAUTION: Do not attempt to use tools or excessive force to release the door handle from ice buildup.

If your vehicle's door handles are black: Perform the following to remove ice from the door handle:
1. Forcefully press the frontmost part of the door handle. It will rock slightly inward to help break the ice.
2. Press the rearmost part of the door handle to try to open as you normally would.
3. Once the door handle is able to move, open and close it a few more times to release any remaining ice buildup. Make sure the door handle is fully pressed in (retracted) prior to entering the vehicle, and check that the door is fully closed before driving away.

If your vehicle's door handles are silver: You can usually remove the ice with a few forceful bumps to the door handle using the bottom of your fist. Perform the following to remove ice from the door handle:
CAUTION: Remove any jewelry or objects that can damage the paint prior to performing the procedure, and do not attempt to use tools or excessive force.
1. Forcefully press the rearmost part of the door handle to try to open the door handle.
2. Working in a circular pattern around the perimeter of the door handle, use the bottom of your fist to forcefully bump the door handle to break and release the ice buildup.
3. Aiming for the rearmost end of the wide part of the door handle, use the bottom of your fist to forcefully bump the door handle. Increase the intensity of the bumps as necessary, repeating steps 1 through 3 until the ice is removed and the door handle can be opened.
CAUTION: Never bump the vehicle so hard as to cause a dent; the force used should be similar to knocking on your neighborâ€™s front door.
4. Once the door handle is able to move, open and close it a few more times to release any remaining ice buildup. Make sure the door handle is fully pressed in (retracted) prior to entering the vehicle, and check that the door is fully closed before driving away.
