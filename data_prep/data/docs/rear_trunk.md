# Rear Trunk

## Opening

To open the rear trunk, ensure Model 3 is in Park, then do one of the following:
- Touch the associated Open button on the touchscreen.
- Double-click the rear trunk button on the key fob.
- Touch the rear trunk button on the mobile app.
- Press the switch located under the rear trunk's exterior handle (a valid key must be detected).

CAUTION: Before opening the rear trunk in an enclosed area (such as a garage), ensure the opening height of the rear trunk is properly adjusted to avoid low-hanging ceilings or objects (see Adjusting Opening Height of Powered Trunk).

Model 3 must be unlocked or detect a key before you can use the switch to open the rear trunk.

Red icon of vehicle with doors open: When a door or trunk is open, the touchscreen displays the Door Open indicator light. The image of your Model 3 on the touchscreen also displays the open trunk.

You can stop a powered trunk (if equipped) while it is moving by single-clicking the rear trunk button on the key fob accessory. Then, when you double-click the rear trunk button, it moves again, but in the opposite direction (provided it was not almost entirely open or closed when you stopped it). For example, if you single-click to stop 
the powered trunk while it is opening, when you double-click, it closes.

Note: In emergency situations, you can override the open or close command for the powered trunk (if equipped) by pressing the trunk switch again or by grasping to stop it in place.

Warning: Before opening or closing the powered trunk (if equipped), it is important to check that the surrounding area is free of obstacles (people and objects). You must proactively monitor the trunk to ensure that it does not come into contact with a person or object. Failure to do so may result in damage or serious injury.

To open the rear trunk from inside the vehicle in the unlikely situation that Model 3 has no power, see Interior Emergency Trunk Release.


## Adjusting Opening Height of Powered Trunk

You can adjust the opening height of the powered trunk (if equipped) to make it easier to reach or to avoid low-hanging ceilings or objects (for example, a garage door or light):
1. Open the trunk, then manually lower or raise it to the desired opening height.
2. Press and hold the button on the underside of the trunk for three seconds until you hear a confirmation chime.
3. Confirm that you have set it to the desired height by closing the powered trunk, then reopening it.

CAUTION: Depending on configuration (such as wheel selection), your vehicle's rear trunk can open up to approximately 6.5 feet (2 meters). Adjust the rear trunk height to prevent it from coming into contact with low ceilings or other objects.


## Closing
- Double-click the rear trunk button on the key fob. 
- Press the switch located on the underside of the rear trunk

To close the powered trunk (if equipped), do one of the following:
- Touch the associated Close button on the touchscreen.
- Press the switch located by the rear trunk's exterior handle.
- Double-click the rear trunk button on the key fob.

If the powered trunk senses an obstruction when closing, it stops moving and sounds two chimes. Remove the obstruction and try closing it again.

Warning: Before driving, ensure that the trunk is securely latched in the fully-closed position by lifting up on the bottom edge and confirming there is no movement.


## Accessing the Cargo Area

To access the cargo area inside the rear trunk, pull up the strap at the rear of the cargo cover. You can then fold the cargo cover forward or remove it from Model 3.

Secure all cargo before moving Model 3, and place heavy cargo in the lower trunk compartment.


## Rear Trunk Load Limits

Distribute the weight of cargo as evenly as possible between the front and rear trunks.

CAUTION: Never load more than 88 lbs (40 kg) in the lower compartment of the rear trunk or more than 287 lbs (130 kg) on the upper compartment. Doing so can cause damage.

Warning: When loading cargo, always consider the vehicle's Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) (see Specifications). The GVWR is the maximum allowable total mass of the vehicle including all passengers, fluids, and cargo.


## Interior Emergency Trunk Release

An illuminated mechanical release located inside the rear trunk allows you to open the rear trunk from the inside if Model 3 has no electrical power. This mechanical release also allows a person locked inside to get out.
1. Firmly press and hold the illuminated button in the direction of the arrow to release the latch.
2. While pressing the button, push the rear trunk open.

Note: The button glows for several hours after a brief exposure to ambient light.

Warning: Do not allow children to play inside the trunk or become locked inside. An unrestrained child could suffer serious injury or death in a crash. A child could suffer heat exhaustion or death if trapped in the vehicle, especially without climate control on.
