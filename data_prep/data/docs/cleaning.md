# Cleaning

## Cleaning the Exterior

To prevent damage to the paint, immediately remove corrosive substances (bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do not wait until Model 3 is due for a complete wash. If necessary, use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol.

Keep the exterior cameras free of dirt, condensation, or obstructions. These substances can cause unclear pictures or Autopilot and safety features to stop working (see #D1E9186).

Follow these steps when washing the exterior of Model 3:
1. Rinse Thoroughly
Before washing, flush grime and grit from the vehicle using a hose. Flush away accumulations of mud in areas where debris easily collects (such as wheel wells and panel seams). If salt has been used on the highways (such as during winter months), thoroughly rinse all traces of road salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel wells, and brakes.
2. Hand Wash
Hand wash Model 3 using a clean soft cloth and cold or lukewarm water and a mild, high-quality car shampoo.
CAUTION: Some cleaners and car shampoos contain chemicals that can cause damage or discoloration, especially to plastic trim pieces, lamps, or camera lenses. For example, some car cleaning formulas contain hydroxide or other highly alkaline or caustic ingredients that can damage exterior components. Do not use acidic products either. Damage or discoloration resulting from cleaning products is not covered by the warranty.
3. Rinse with Clean Water
After washing, rinse with clean water to prevent soap from drying on the surfaces.
4. Dry Thoroughly and Clean Exterior Glass
After washing and rinsing, dry thoroughly with a chamois. If necessary, dry the brakes by going on a short drive and applying the brakes multiple times.


## Window Cleaning and Treatments

Clean windows and mirrors using an automotive glass cleaner. Do not scrape or use any abrasive cleaning fluid on glass or mirrored surfaces. Follow the directions in Cleaning the Exterior for best practices in cleaning the exterior glass.

To add a hydrophobic coating to your vehicle's windows, apply the coating only to the side and rear windows, not the front windshield—doing so may affect the visibility of the autopilot cameras. Follow the hydrophobic coating manufacturer’s instructions for application details.

Note: Tesla is not responsible for any damage associated with applying window treatments on your vehicle.


## Car Wash Mode

When taking Model 3 to a car wash, Car Wash Mode closes all windows, locks the charge port, and disables windshield wipers, Sentry Mode, walk-away door locking, and parking sensor chimes. To enable, touch Controls > Service > Car Wash Mode. Your vehicle must be stationary and not actively charging.

If using an automatic car wash, Enable Free Roll keeps your vehicle in Neutral and activates free roll for the duration of the wash, while preventing Model 3 from applying the Parking brake if you leave the driver's seat. To enable, press on the brake pedal and touch Enable Free Roll; or shift into Neutral.

Car Wash Mode disables if the vehicle's speed exceeds 9 mph (15 km/h) or by touching Exit on the touchscreen.

CAUTION: Failure to put Model 3 in Car Wash Mode may result in damage (for example, to the charge port or windshield wipers). Damage caused by car washes is not covered by the warranty.


## Cleaning a Camera

To ensure a clear picture, the camera lens must be clean and free of obstructions.

Remove any build-up of dirt or debris by spraying water onto the camera lens with a spray bottle. Do not attempt to remove dirt or debris by wiping an exposed lens with your hands or a cloth. This debris can damage the surface of the lens when rubbed against it during wiping.

CAUTION: Do not use chemical-based or abrasive cleaners. Doing so can damage the surface of the lens.

CAUTION: Do not clean an ultrasonic sensor (if equipped) or camera lens with a sharp or abrasive object that can scratch or damage its surface.


## Cautions for Exterior Cleaning

CAUTION: Do not wash in direct sunlight.

CAUTION: Do not use windshield treatment fluids. Doing so can interfere with wiper friction and cause a chattering sound.

CAUTION: Do not use hot water, detergents, or highly alkaline or caustic cleaning products, especially those containing hydroxide.

CAUTION: If using a pressure washer, maintain a distance of at least 12" (30 cm) between the nozzle and the surface of Model 3. Avoid aiming the water jet directly at parking sensors (if equipped). Keep the nozzle moving and do not concentrate the water jet on any one area.

CAUTION: Do not aim water hoses directly at windows, door, or hood seals or at electronic modules or exposed cabling.

CAUTION: To avoid corrosive damage that may not be covered by the warranty, rinse away any road salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel wells, and brakes. After cleaning the vehicle, dry the brakes by going on a short drive and applying the brakes multiple times.

CAUTION: Avoid using tight-napped or rough cloths, such as washing mitts. A high-quality microfiber cleaning cloth is recommended.

CAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, use touchless car washes only. These car washes have no parts (brushes, etc.) that touch the surfaces of Model 3. Some touchless car washes use caustic solutions that, over time, can cause discoloration of decorative exterior trim. Avoid exposure to soaps and chemicals above pH 13. If unsure, check the product label or ask the staff at the car wash. Damage caused by improper washing is not covered by the warranty.

CAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, make sure the vehicle is locked. In addition, avoid using controls on the touchscreen that can result in accidentally opening doors or trunks while the vehicle is being washed. Any damage caused is not covered by the warranty.

CAUTION: Ensure the wipers are off before washing Model 3 to avoid the risk of damaging the wipers.

CAUTION: Do not use chemical based wheel cleaners or pre-wash products. These can damage the finish on the wheels.

Warning: Never spray liquid at a high velocity (for example, if using a pressure washer) towards the charge port while Model 3 is charging. Failure to follow these instructions can result in serious injury or damage to the vehicle, charging equipment, or property.


## Cleaning the Interior

Frequently inspect and clean the interior to maintain its appearance and to prevent premature wear. If possible, immediately wipe up spills and remove marks. For general cleaning, wipe interior surfaces using a soft cloth (such as microfiber) dampened with a mixture of warm water and mild non-detergent cleaner (test all cleaners on a concealed area before use). To avoid streaks, dry immediately with a soft lint-free cloth.

### Interior Glass

Do not scrape, or use any abrasive cleaning fluid on glass or mirrored surfaces. This can damage the reflective surface of the mirror and the heating elements in the rear window.

### Airbags

Do not allow any substance to enter an airbag cover. This could affect correct operation.

### Dashboard and Plastic Surfaces

Do not polish the upper surfaces of the dashboard. Polished surfaces are reflective and could interfere with your driving view.

### Seats

Wipe spills and chemical residues from interior surfaces as soon as possible using a soft cloth moistened with warm water and non-detergent soap. Wipe gently in a circular motion. Then wipe dry using a soft, lint-free cloth.

Although seating surfaces are designed to repel stains, Tesla recommends regular cleaning to maintain performance and an as-new appearance. Promptly treat dye transfer from clothing, such as indigo-dyed denim. Avoid contact with harsh chemicals, including certain cosmetics. Never use cleaners containing alcohol or bleach. Spot-test cleaners on an inconspicuous area before applying to visible surfaces.

Vacuum seats as needed to remove any loose dirt.

CAUTION: Aftermarket, non-Tesla seat covers may inhibit the sensitivity of a seat's occupancy sensors and may cause staining or damage.

### Carpets

Avoid over-wetting carpets. For heavily soiled areas, use a diluted upholstery cleaner.

### Seat Belts

Extend the belts to wipe. Do not use any type of detergent or chemical cleaning agent. Allow the belts to dry naturally while extended, preferably away from direct sunlight.

### Door Seals

Wipe door seals with a damp cloth to remove any debris. Excessive debris on the door seals can cause damage when contacting surrounding surfaces. Avoid using alcohol wipes or any chemical products that can potentially deteriorate the coating on the door seals.

### Touchscreen

Clean the touchscreen(s) using a soft lint-free cloth specifically designed to clean monitors and displays. Do not use cleaners (such as a glass cleaner) or alcohol-based gel products (such as hand sanitizer) and do not use a wet wipe or a dry statically-charged cloth (such as a recently washed microfiber). To wipe the front touchscreen without activating buttons and changing settings, you can enable Screen Clean Mode. Touch Controls > Display > Screen Clean Mode. The display darkens to make it easy to see dust and smudges. To exit Screen Clean Mode, press and hold HOLD TO EXIT.

### Chrome and Metal Surfaces

Polish, abrasive cleaners, alcohol-based gel products (such as hand sanitizer), and hard cloths can damage the finish on chrome and metal surfaces.

### Cautions for Interior Cleaning

CAUTION: Using solvents (including alcohol), alcohol-based gel products (such as hand sanitizer), bleach, citrus, naphtha, or silicone-based products or additives on interior components can cause damage.

CAUTION: Statically-charged materials can cause damage to the touchscreen.

Warning: If you notice any damage on an airbag or seat belt, contact Tesla immediately.

Warning: Do not allow any water, cleaners, or fabric to enter a seat belt mechanism.

Warning: Exposure to chemical cleaners can be hazardous and can irritate eyes and skin. Read and observe the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the chemical cleaner.


## Polishing, Touch Up, and Body Repair

To preserve the cosmetic appearance of the body, you can occasionally treat the paint surfaces with an approved polish containing:
- Very mild abrasive to remove surface contamination without removing or damaging the paint.
- Filling compounds that fill scratches and reduce their visibility.
- Wax to provide a protective coating between the paint and environmental elements.

Regularly inspect the exterior paint for damage. Treat minor chips and scratches using a paint touch-up pen (available for purchase from Tesla, depending on market region). Use the touch-up pen after washing but before polishing or waxing.

Repair rock chips, fractures or scratches. Refer to https://www.tesla.com/support/body-shop-support for more information on repair locations and available services.

CAUTION: Do not use cutting pastes, color restoration compounds, or polishes containing harsh abrasives. These can scour the surface and permanently damage the paint.

CAUTION: Do not use chrome polish or other abrasive cleaners.


## Using a Car Cover

To preserve the cosmetic appearance of the body when Model 3 is not being used, use a genuine Tesla car cover. Car covers can be purchased from Tesla. See Parts and Accessories.

CAUTION: Use only a Tesla-approved car cover when Model 3 is plugged in. Using a non-Tesla car cover can prevent the Battery from being adequately cooled during charging.


## Floor Mats

To extend the life of your carpet and make them easier to clean, use genuine Tesla floor mats (see Parts and Accessories). Maintain floor mats by regularly cleaning them and checking that they are properly attached. Replace floor mats if they become excessively worn.

Warning: To avoid potential interference with a foot pedal, ensure that the driver’s floor mat is securely fastened, and never place an additional floor mat on top of it. Floor mats should always rest on top of the vehicle carpeting surface and not on another floor mat or other covering.
