# Replacing the Key Fob Battery

Under normal use, the accessory key fob has a battery that lasts for up to one year, depending on key fob version and selected vehicle settings. When the battery is low, a message displays on the touchscreen.

To replace the key fob battery:
1. With the key fob placed button side down on a soft surface, release the bottom cover, using a small flat-bladed tool.
2. Remove the battery by lifting it away from the retaining clips.
3. While avoiding touching the battery's flat surfaces, insert the new battery (type CR2032 ) with the ‘+’ side facing up.
Note: Wipe the battery clean before fitting and avoid touching the battery's flat surfaces. Finger marks on the flat surfaces of the battery can reduce battery life.
Note: CR2032 batteries can be purchased from any retailer that sells batteries.
4. Holding the bottom cover at an angle, align the tabs on the cover with the corresponding slots on the key fob, then press the cover firmly onto the key fob until it snaps into place.
5. Test that the key fob works by unlocking and locking Model 3.

Warning: Key fob batteries contain a chemical burn hazard and should not be ingested. The key fob contains a coin cell battery. If the coin cell battery is swallowed, it can cause severe internal burns within two hours and can lead to death. Keep new and used batteries away from children. If the battery compartment does not close securely, stop using the product and keep it away from children. If you think batteries might have been swallowed or placed inside any part of the body, seek immediate medical attention.
