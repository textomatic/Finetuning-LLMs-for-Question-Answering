# Voice Commands

Note: Voice commands are not available in all languages. To choose the language you want to use for voice commands, touch Controls > Display > Voice Recognition Language.

Use voice commands to easily control settings and preferences without using the touchscreen. Voice commands are designed to understand natural requests. You can use them to:
- Adjust climate preferences.
- Tweak the windshield wiper speed and frequency.
- Control various aspects of your vehicle.
- Navigate to a location.
- Call a contact.
- Interact with apps and settings.

To initiate a voice command, press and release the right scroll wheel button on the steering wheel. When a chime sounds, make your request and Model 3 responds.


## Examples of Voice Commands

Here is a list of example voice commands. This is not an exhaustive list. Tesla is constantly working to improve voice commands.

### Climate Controls
Adjust your climate preferences using voice commands:
- "Make it cooler"
- "Make it warmer"
- "Turn on/off the driver's seat heater"
- "Cool down the passenger"
- "Direct airflow to my face"
- "Sync climate"
- "Increase/decrease the fan speed"
- "Turn on/off rear defroster"
- "Set the temperature/fan..."
- "Turn on recirculate"

### Windshield Wipers
Update the windshield wiper speed and frequency based on changing road and weather conditions:
- "Speed up the wipers"
- "Increase/decrease windshield wiper speed by..."
- "Turn on/off the wipers"

### Vehicle Controls
You can also modify various controls in your vehicle using voice commands:
Note
Your vehicle must be in Park to enable some voice commands (such as Sentry Mode, Dog Mode, etc.).
- "Sentry Mode on/off"
- "Keep my car safe"
- "Lock/unlock the doors"
- "Turn on Dog Mode"
- "Fold/unfold the mirrors"
- "Open/close charge port"

### Navigation
To search for, or navigate to, a location, say:

- "Drive to [location]"
- "Navigate to [location]"
- "Show nearby Superchargers"
- "I'm feeling hungry/lucky" (see Maps and Navigation).
- "Stop navigation"

If you have defined a navigation address for your home or work locations, you can use a voice command to navigate there by saying "Navigate home" or "Take me to work".

### Contacts
To call or text a contact on your Bluetooth-connected phone (see Phone, Calendar, and Web Conferencing), say:

To improve voice command recognition accuracy, provide multiple cues in your command, such as artist and song.

### Apps and Settings
Easily navigate through your apps and settings using voice commands:
- "Open [Toybox/browser/theater/phone]"
- "Search for..."
- "The screen is too bright"

Some apps and settings are only accessible while in Park.
You can also file a bug report by saying "Report" , "Feedback", or "Bug report".

Note: Tesla is continuously improving the ability of Model 3 to recognize voice commands. To support these ongoing quality improvements, Tesla captures short voice recordings anonymously. To protect your privacy, these short recordings are not associated with your personal information or with your vehicle's identification number. Tesla assures that it is not possible to search any system for a recording associated with a specific customer or vehicle.
