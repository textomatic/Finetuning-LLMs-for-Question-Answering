# Pedestrian Warning System (if equipped)

The Pedestrian Warning System causes Model 3 to emit sound when driving below approximately 19 mph (32 km/h) or while driving in reverse. Electric vehicles operate quietly and this sound helps to alert pedestrians of your oncoming vehicle. The sound, which activates whenever Model 3 is shifted out of Park, gets louder as speed increases.

Warning: Use the Pause switch to silence the alarm only when absolutely necessary and when there are no other road users in the surrounding area. You must turn the Pedestrian Warning System back on immediately after the circumstances that required you to turn it off have passed.

Note: The Pedestrian Warning System may not be available in vehicles manufactured prior to approximately September 1, 2019.

Warning: If sound cannot be heard, pedestrians may not be aware of your oncoming vehicle, which may increase the likelihood of a collision resulting in serious injury or death. If the Pedestrian Warning System is not operating, immediately contact Tesla.
