# Checking and Adjusting Tire Pressures

Follow these steps when tires are cold and Model 3 has been stationary for over three hours:
1. Refer to the Tire and Loading Information label located on the driverâ€™s center door pillar for the target tire pressure.
2. Remove the valve cap.
3. Firmly press an accurate tire pressure gauge onto the valve to measure pressure.
4. If required, add or remove air to reach the recommended pressure.
Note: You can release air by pressing the metal stem in the center of the valve.
5. Re-check pressure using the accurate tire gauge.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary until the tire pressure is correct.
7. Reinstall the valve cap to prevent dirt from entering. Periodically check the valve for damage and leaks.
