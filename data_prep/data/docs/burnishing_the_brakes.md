# Burnishing the Brakes

You should burnish the brakes after replacing brake pads and/or brake rotors. In addition, burnishing the brakes might eliminate a situation where the brakes emit a high-pitched squealing noise while braking, especially if the noise is present while driving in the rain, driving in cold and/or humid climates, or if there is surface rust present on the brake components. Note that all vehicles with disk brakes can experience this situation and that braking performance is not affected.

To burnish the brakes: <br>
Note: Be sure to comply with all local traffic safety laws and only perform maneuvers in a suitable location where such activity is legal, with little to no traffic.
1. Drive the vehicle at approximately 50 mph - 55 mph (80 km/h - 90 km/h) on a straight road.
2. Apply moderate, consistent pressure to the brake pedal to slowly decelerate the vehicle, releasing at 10 mph (15 km/h).
3. Repeat this procedure 6 times, waiting at least 30 seconds between applications.

Note: If the noise still persists, use your mobile app to contact Tesla or schedule a Service appointment.
