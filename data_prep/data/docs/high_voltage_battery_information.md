# High Voltage Battery Information

## About the High Voltage Battery

Model 3 has one of the most sophisticated battery systems in the world. The most important way to preserve the high voltage Battery is to LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE PLUGGED IN when you are not using it. This is particularly important if you are not planning to drive Model 3 for several weeks.

Note: When left idle and unplugged, your vehicle periodically uses energy from the Battery for system tests and recharging the low voltage battery when necessary.

There is no advantage to waiting until the Battery’s level is low before charging. In fact, the Battery performs best when charged regularly.

Note: If you allow the Battery to discharge to 0%, other components may become damaged or require replacement (for example, the low voltage battery). In these cases, you are responsible for repair and/or transporting expenses. Discharge-related expenses are not covered by the warranty or under the Roadside Assistance policy.

The peak charging rate of the Battery may decrease slightly after a large number of DC Fast Charging sessions, such as those at Superchargers. To ensure maximum driving range and Battery safety, the Battery charge rate is decreased when the Battery is too cold, when the Battery’s charge is nearly full, and when the Battery conditions change with usage and age. These changes in the condition of the Battery are driven by battery physics and may increase the total Supercharging duration by a few minutes over time. You can minimize the amount of charge time by using Trip Planner (if available in your market region) to warm the Battery while driving to a Supercharger. See Trip Planner for more information.


## Battery Care

Never allow the Battery to fully discharge. Even when Model 3 is not being driven, its Battery discharges very slowly to power the onboard electronics. The Battery can discharge at a rate of approximately 1% per day, though the discharge rate may vary depending on environmental factors (such as cold weather), vehicle configuration, and your selected settings on the touchscreen. Situations can arise in which you must leave Model 3 unplugged for an extended period of time (for example, at an airport when traveling). In these situations, keep the 1% in mind to ensure that you leave the Battery with a sufficient charge level. For example, over a two week period (14 days), the Battery may discharge by approximately 14%.

Discharging the Battery to 0% may result in damage to vehicle components. To protect against a complete discharge, Model 3 enters a low-power consumption mode when the displayed charge level drops to approximately 0%. In this mode, the Battery stops supporting the onboard electronics and auxiliary low voltage battery. Once this low-power consumption mode is active, immediately plug in Model 3 to prevent a jump start and low voltage battery replacement.

Note: If Model 3 is unresponsive and does not unlock, open, or charge, the low voltage battery may be discharged. In this situation, try jump starting the low voltage battery (see Jump Starting). If the vehicle is still unresponsive, contact Tesla.


## Temperature Limits

For better long-term performance, avoid exposing Model 3 to ambient temperatures above 140° F (60° C) or below -22° F (-30° C) for more than 24 hours at a time.


## Energy Saving Feature

Model 3 has an energy-saving feature that reduces the amount of energy being consumed by the displays when Model 3 is not in use. On newer vehicles, this feature is automated to provide an optimal level of energy saving. However, on older vehicles, you can control the amount of energy being consumed by the displays by touching Controls > Display > Energy Saving. For more information on maximizing range and saving energy, see Getting Maximum Range.


## Submerged Vehicle

As with any electric vehicle, if your Tesla has been exposed to flooding, extreme weather events or has otherwise been submerged in water (especially in salt water), treat it as if it’s been in an accident and contact your insurance company for support. Do not attempt to operate the vehicle before Tesla Service has inspected it, but you should tow or move it away from any structures.

Note: Damage caused by water is not covered under warranty.


## Battery Warnings and Cautions

Warning: The Battery has no parts that an owner or a non-Tesla authorized service technician can service. Under no circumstances should you open or tamper with the Battery. Always contact Tesla to arrange for Battery servicing.

CAUTION: If the Battery’s charge level falls to 0%, you must plug it in. If you leave it unplugged for an extended period, it may not be possible to charge or use Model 3 without jump starting or replacing the low voltage battery. Leaving Model 3 unplugged for an extended period can also result in permanent Battery damage. If you are unable to charge Model 3 after attempting to jump start the low voltage battery, contact Tesla immediately.

CAUTION: The Battery requires no owner maintenance. Do not remove the coolant filler cap and do not add fluid. If the touchscreen warns you that the fluid level is low, contact Tesla immediately.

CAUTION: Do not use the Battery as a stationary power source. Doing so voids the warranty.
