# Mirrors

## Adjusting Exterior Mirrors

Adjust the exterior mirrors by touching Controls > Mirrors. Press the left scroll button on the steering wheel to choose whether you are adjusting the Left or Right mirror. Then use the left scroll button as follows to adjust the selected mirror to its desired position:
- To move the mirror up or down, roll the left scroll button up or down.
- To move the mirror inward or outward, press the left scroll button to the left or right.

Both exterior mirrors can tilt downward when the vehicle is shifted into Reverse. When you shift back into another drive mode, the mirrors return to their normal upward position. To turn this feature on or off, touch Controls > Mirrors > Mirror Auto Tilt.

Note: With a future software update, the Save button will retain the mirror adjustments but it does not function currently.

To reduce glare when driving at night, the rear view mirror and exterior side mirrors dim automatically. To enable or disable this feature, touch Controls > Mirrors > Mirror Auto Dim.

Availability of this Mirror Auto Dim depends on market region and date of manufacture.

Note: Both exterior mirrors have heaters that turn on and off with the rear window defroster.


## Folding Mirrors

To manually fold and unfold exterior mirrors (for example, parking in a narrow garage, tight space, etc.), touch Controls > Fold/Unfold Mirrors.

When you manually fold the mirrors, they remain folded until your driving speed reaches 31 mph (50 km/h) (or until you manually unfold them by touching Controls > Unfold Mirrors).

Note: You cannot fold a mirror when driving over 31 mph (50 km/h).

To set the mirrors to fold automatically whenever you exit and lock Model 3 touch Controls > Mirrors > Mirror Auto Fold. The mirrors unfold automatically when you unlock Model 3.

You can also set mirrors to fold automatically whenever you arrive at a specific location, which saves you from having to manually fold them each time you arrive at a frequented place. To set this up, stop at the location you want to save (or drive at less than 3 mph (5 km/h)), and fold the mirrors. Save Location appears briefly below the Fold Mirrors control. Touch again if you no longer want mirrors to automatically fold at the location, or disable this option in Controls.

Note: When you leave the saved location, mirrors remain folded until your driving speed reaches 31 mph (50 km/h), or until you touch Controls > Unfold Mirrors.

CAUTION: Mirrors may not automatically fold if you return to a saved location and are driving faster than 3 mph/5 km/h.

Note: You can override the automatic folding/unfolding of mirrors at any time (for example, Model 3 has no power) by pushing the mirror assembly away from you to unfold, or pulling it toward you to fold.

Note: If you expect ice to accumulate when Model 3 is parked, turn off Mirror Auto Fold. Accumulation of ice can prevent exterior side mirrors from folding or unfolding. See Cold Weather Best Practices for information on how to ensure your mirrors function properly in cold weather.

You can integrate auto-folding mirrors with HomeLink (see Smart Garage). To enable, go to HomeLink > Auto-Fold Mirrors when Nearby.


## Rear View Mirror

Adjust the rear view mirror manually. When in Drive or Neutral, the rear view mirror automatically dims in low lighting conditions based on the time of day (for example, when driving at night).


## Vanity Mirrors
To expose and illuminate the vanity mirror, fold the sun visor downwards, then use the tab to lower the mirror cover. After closing the mirror cover, the light turns off.
