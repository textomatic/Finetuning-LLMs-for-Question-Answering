In addition to housing an RFID transmitter that reads key fobs and key cards (see GUID-E004FAB7-1C71-448F-9492-CACF301304D2.html#CONCEPT_E2Q_KMD_K1B), the center console includes cup holders, two storage compartments, and a wireless phone charger (see Interior Storage).

## Coat Hangers

Your Model 3 has a coat hanger on each side of the vehicle in the second row. Push the coat hanger to release it. Push it again to retract it.


## Glovebox

To open the glovebox, touch Controls > Glovebox. The glovebox automatically opens and its light turns on.

To close the glovebox, push it upward until it clicks into its closed position.
For additional glovebox security, touch Controls > Safety > Glovebox PIN to set a 4-digit PIN (see Glovebox PIN).

Note: The glovebox locks whenever closed and you lock Model 3 using the mobile app, key card, you leave Model 3 carrying your phone key (if Walk-Away Door Lock is turned on), or if Valet mode is active (see Valet Mode). It does not lock when Model 3 is locked by touching the lock icon on the touchscreen.

Warning: When driving, keep the glovebox closed to prevent injury to a passenger if a collision or sudden stop occurs.
