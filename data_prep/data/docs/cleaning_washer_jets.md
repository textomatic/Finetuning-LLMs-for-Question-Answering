# Cleaning Washer Jets

If a windshield washer becomes blocked, use a thin strand of wire to clear any blockages from the nozzles.

Warning: Do not operate the washers while cleaning Model 3. Windshield washer fluid can irritate eyes and skin. Read and observe the washer fluid manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
