# Topping Up Windshield Washer Fluid

The only reservoir into which you can add fluid is the windshield washer fluid reservoir, which is located behind the front trunk. When the level is low, a message displays on the touchscreen.

To top up the washer fluid:
1. Open the hood.
2. Clean around the filler cap before opening it to prevent dirt from entering the reservoir.
3. Open the filler cap.
4. While avoiding spilling, fill the reservoir until the fluid level is visible just below the filler neck. The reservoir has a capacity of 3.2 liters.
5. Wipe up any spills immediately and wash the affected area with water.
6. Reinstall the filler cap.

CAUTION: Use only windshield washer fluid meant for automotive vehicles. Using other substances, such as untreated water, can result in bacterial growth within the climate control system resulting in odor or potential damage that is not covered by warranty.

Note: Some national or local regulations restrict the use of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). VOCs are commonly used as antifreeze in washer fluid. Use a washer fluid with limited VOC content only if it provides adequate freeze resistance for all climates in which you drive Model 3.

CAUTION: Do not add formulated washer fluids that contain water repellent or bug wash. These fluids can cause streaking, smearing, and squeaking or other noises.

Warning: In temperatures below 40° F (4° C), use a washer fluid with antifreeze. In cold weather, using a washer fluid without antifreeze can impair visibility through the windshield.

Warning: Windshield washer fluid can irritate eyes and skin. Read and observe the instructions provided by the washer fluid manufacturer.
