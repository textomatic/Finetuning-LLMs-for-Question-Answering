# Removing Rocks/Debris From Brake Shield

In the rare case that you suddenly hear a groaning, grinding, or scraping sound coming from your vehicle's brakes or wheels while driving (even at very low speeds), it is likely that a rock or debris has become wedged between the brake rotor and brake shield.

The noise is due to the rock or debris scraping against the brake rotor as the brake rotor turns with the wheel. This situation does not impact braking performance, but you should remove the rock or debris as soon as you can.

To remove the rock or debris from the brake shield:
Warning: If the vehicle was recently driven, brake components may be hot. To avoid personal injury, do not touch hot brake components.
1. Shift into Park.
2. Remove the aero cover from the wheel, if equipped. See Removing and Installing Aero Covers.
3. With a gloved hand, carefully push on the top, sides, and bottom of the brake shield until the rock or debris falls out.
CAUTION: Avoid using tools or objects that can damage the brake shield or wheel. Do not press too hard on the brake shield so as to permanently bend it.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 on the other brake shields, if necessary.
5. Confirm that the noise is no longer present.
6. Reinstall the aero cover onto the wheel, if equipped. See Removing and Installing Aero Covers.

Note: If the above procedure did not successfully remove the rock or debris, try driving slowly alternating between Drive and Reverse (drive forward for a few seconds, stop, then slowly drive backwards for a few seconds). Repeat this several times or until the noise is no longer present, taking care to do so in a safe area and carefully monitoring your surroundings. If the noise still persists, use your mobile app to contact Tesla or schedule a Service appointment.
