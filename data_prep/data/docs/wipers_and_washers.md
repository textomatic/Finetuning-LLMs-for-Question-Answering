# Wipers and Washers

## Wipers

There are several ways to access wiper settings:
- Press the button on the end of the turn signal stalk.
- Touch Controls > Wipers.
- Add wipers to the bottom bar. See Customizing My Apps.

To adjust the wiper settings, press the left scroll wheel on the steering wheel left or right, use the touchscreen or use voice commands (see Voice Commands).

The button at the end of turn signal stalk has two levels. Press partially for a single wipe without any washer fluid. Press fully for both wipe and wash.

II - Intermittent, fast
III - Continuous, slow
IIII - Continuous, fast
Auto - Model 3 detects whether or not it is raining. When wipers are set to Auto and liquid is detected on the windshield, Model 3 determines the optimal frequency at which they should wipe. If Model 3 does not detect liquid on the windshield, the wipers do not wipe.

Note: Autopilot requires wipers to be set to Auto. This setting is automatic and you cannot change it.

Note: The Auto setting is currently in BETA. If uncertain about using the Auto setting while in the BETA phase, Tesla recommends operating the wipers manually, as necessary.

CAUTION: Ensure the wipers are off before washing Model 3 to avoid the risk of damaging the wipers.

Periodically check and clean the edge of the wiper blades. If a blade is damaged, replace it immediately. For details on checking and replacing wiper blades, see Windshield Wiper Blades, Jets and Fluid.

CAUTION: To avoid damaging the hood, ensure that the hood is fully closed before using the windshield wipers.

CAUTION: In harsh climates, ensure that the wiper blades are not frozen or adhered to the windshield. Remove ice from the windshield before using the wipers. Ice has sharp edges that can damage the rubber on the blades.


## Windshield Washers

Press the button on the end of the turn signal stalk to spray washer fluid onto the windshield. This button has two levels. Press partially for a single wipe without any washer fluid. Press fully for both wipe and wash. When washing the windshield, the wipers turn on. While spraying the windshield, the wipers turn on. After releasing the button, the wipers perform two additional wipes then, depending on vehicle and environmental conditions, a third wipe a few seconds later.

Periodically top up washer fluid (see Topping Up Windshield Washer Fluid).
