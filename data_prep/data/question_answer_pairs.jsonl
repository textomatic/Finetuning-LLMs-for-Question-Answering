{"text": "<s>[INST] What are the operating tips for the climate control system in extremely cold weather or icy conditions? [/INST] In extremely cold weather or icy conditions, there are several operating tips for the climate control system in a Tesla Model 3:\n\n1. **Charge Port Latch**: The charge port latch may freeze in extremely cold weather or icy conditions. If you cannot remove or insert the charge cable, or your vehicle is not Supercharging due to the latch being frozen in place, you can enable \"Defrost Car\" in the mobile app. This helps thaw ice on the charge port latch so the charge cable can be removed or inserted.\n\n2. **Heat Pump Efficiency**: If your vehicle is equipped with a heat pump, you can improve the efficiency of the cabin heating by reducing your selected acceleration mode. This allows the heat pump system to take more heat from the Battery to efficiently heat the cabin, instead of maintaining the Battery's ability to provide peak acceleration performance. Note that when subsequently increasing the acceleration mode, the Battery requires time to warm up before the increased level of acceleration is available.\n\n3. **Exterior Grille Maintenance**: To ensure the climate control system operates efficiently, close all windows and ensure that the exterior grille in front of the windshield is free of ice, snow, leaves, and other debris.\n\n4. **Whining Noise**: Even when not in use, you may hear Model 3 emit a whining noise or the sound of water circulating. These sounds are normal and occur when the internal cooling systems turn on to support various vehicle functions, such as maintaining the low voltage battery and balancing the temperature of the high voltage Battery.\n\n5. **Cabin Venting**: To reduce the temperature in the cabin in hot weather conditions, the fan may turn on to vent the cabin when the vehicle is parked. This occurs only if the battery's charge level is above 20%.\n\nThese tips are designed to help users effectively manage the climate control system in extremely cold weather or icy conditions, ensuring the comfort and functionality of the vehicle.</s>"}

{"text": "<s>[INST] What are the options available for Stopping Mode in Model 3, and what are the warnings associated with each option? [/INST] In the Model 3, there are three options available for Stopping Mode, each with its associated warnings:\n\n1. Creep: When close to, or at, a complete stop, the motor continues to apply torque, moving Model 3 slowly forward (in Drive) or backwards (in Reverse), similar to a conventional vehicle with an automatic transmission. In some situations, such as on a steep hill or driveway, you may need to press the accelerator pedal to continue moving or to prevent Model 3 from moving in the opposite direction.\n\n   Warning: Never rely on Creep to apply enough torque to prevent your vehicle from rolling down a hill. Always press the brake pedal to remain stopped or the accelerator pedal to proceed up the hill. Failure to do so can result in property damage and/or a collision.\n\n2. Hold: Maximizes range and reduces brake wear by continuing to provide regenerative braking at speeds lower than with the Creep and Roll settings. When Model 3 stops, the brakes are automatically applied without you having to put your foot on the brake pedal. Whether stopped on a flat surface or a hill, Vehicle Hold keeps the brake applied, provided your foot remains off the accelerator and brake pedals.\n\n   Warning: Never rely on Hold to adequately decelerate or fully stop your vehicle. Many factors can contribute to a longer stopping distance, including downward slopes, and reduced or limited regenerative braking. Always be prepared to use the brake pedal to adequately decelerate or stop.\n\n3. Roll: When close to, or at, a complete stop, Model 3 becomes free rolling like a vehicle in Neutral. Therefore, if stopped on a slope, Model 3 will roll downward. The brake does not engage, and the motor does not apply torque (until the accelerator pedal is pressed).\n\n   Note: If you choose Creep or Roll, you can still use Vehicle Hold to apply the brakes. However, you will need to briefly press the brake pedal when the vehicle is stopped.\n\n   Note: When Model 3 is in Track Mode, Roll is automatically enabled, regardless of your chosen setting. When no longer in Track Mode, Model 3 reverts to your chosen setting.\n\n   Warning: Press the brake pedal if Model 3 moves when unsafe to do so. It is your responsibility to stay alert and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious damage, injury, or death.\n\n   Warning: Do not rely on regenerative braking and your chosen Stopping Mode to keep you and your vehicle safe. Various factors such as driving with a heavy vehicle load, on a steep hill, or on wet or icy roads affect deceleration rate and the distance at which Model 3 will come to a stop. Drive attentively and always stay prepared to use the brake pedal to stop as appropriate based on traffic and road conditions.\n\nIn summary, the Creep mode allows the vehicle to move slowly forward or backward, Hold mode automatically applies the brakes when the vehicle stops, and Roll mode allows the vehicle to roll freely like a vehicle in Neutral. Each mode has specific warnings associated with it to ensure safe operation and driving practices.</s>"}
