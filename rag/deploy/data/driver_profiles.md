# Driver Profiles

When you first adjust the driver’s seat, steering wheel position, or exterior side mirrors, the touchscreen prompts you to create a driver profile to save these adjustments. Your profile also saves various preferences you make while customizing Model 3.

To save your profile settings to the cloud and access them across multiple Tesla vehicles, set up a Tesla Profile (see Using Tesla Profiles).

To add a new driver profile, touch the driver profile icon at the top of the touchscreen. Then touch Driver Profile Settings > Add New Driver, type the driver's name and touch Create Profile. Follow the onscreen instructions to save mirror and steering wheel position to the driver profile. Check the Use Easy Entry checkbox if you want to save (or use existing) Easy Entry settings in which the driver's seat and the steering wheel are automatically adjusted to make it easy to enter and exit Model 3.

If you change the position of the driver’s seat, steering wheel, or exterior side mirrors after you have saved or chosen a driver profile, the touchscreen prompts you to Save the new position or Restore the previously saved position (other settings are automatically saved). To change a setting without saving or restoring, just ignore the prompt.

To delete a driver profile, touch the driver profile icon at the top of the touchscreen, touch Driver Profile Settings and select the driver profile you would like the remove. Once selected, there is an option to Delete the driver profile.

Note: Valet mode is a built-in driver profile that limits speed and restricts access to some Model 3 features (see Valet Mode).

Note: To stop automatic adjustments that are in process based on a driver's profile, touch Stop on the Driver Profile dropdown menu. Automatic adjustments also stop if you manually adjust a seat, mirror, or the steering wheel.


## Selecting Between Driver Profiles

To adjust Model 3 based on a driver’s profile, touch the driver profile icon at the top of the Controls screen. Then choose the driver, and Model 3 is adjusted based on the settings that have been saved to the chosen driver profile. See Using Tesla Profiles to learn more about saving profile settings to the cloud for easy access across multiple Tesla vehicles.

Note: Your preferred Stopping Mode setting does not sync to your driver profile. For more information, see GUID-3DFFB071-C0F6-474D-8A45-17BE1A006365.html#STOPPINGMODE3.


## Using Tesla Profiles

Driver profile settings, such as seat adjustments, temperature preferences, navigation Recents and Favorites, media settings, and data sharing preferences can be saved into a Tesla Profile that is synced to every supported vehicle under your Tesla Account. This provides convenient access to your profile settings and preferences across all your Tesla supported vehicles.

To set up your Tesla Profile, navigate to Driver Profile Settings and select your Tesla Account name. You can choose to set it up as a New Profile or copy the settings from an existing driver profile that you were previously using.

To set up a Tesla Profile for additional drivers, share your vehicle with them from the mobile app and navigate to Security & Drivers > Manage Drivers > Add Driver. Their Tesla Profile will appear in the Driver Profile settings after accepting the invitation from their Tesla Account. If you remove their access to the vehicle, it also removes their Tesla Profile. For more information on granting mobile app access, see Granting Access to a Second Driver. In addition, you can change your profile picture from your Tesla Mobile App.

Note: Some vehicle settings, such as seat, mirror, steering wheel, and air vent positions are only synced between the same vehicle models. If the seat or steering positions do not restore as expected, touch Controls > Service > Seat & Steering Calibration on the affected vehicles.

Note: Tesla Profiles are supported on vehicles with software versions 2022.24 or higher.

To remove your Tesla Profile from a vehicle, remove that vehicle from your Tesla account:
1. In the Tesla mobile app, touch the profile icon in the top-right corner.
2. Touch Add/Remove Products.
3. Touch Remove.
4. Select the vehicle you'd like to remove.


## Saved Settings

A subset of the settings that you choose to customize your Model 3 are automatically saved to your driver's profile. Once saved, a green check mark appears next to the driver profile icon on the touchscreen. Examples of automatically saved driver profile settings are:
- Navigation, temperature, lights and display settings.
- Autopilot and driving preferences.


## Linking a Driver Profile to a Key

You can link a driver profile to a key (or keys) to allow Model 3 to automatically select the correct driver profile when the linked key is detected as you approach the vehicle and open the driver's door. To link a driver profile to a key, first ensure you are using your desired driver profile, then touch Controls > Locks > Keys. You can toggle the driver icon to link or delete a key to the desired driver profile. The name of the driver profile appears under the key to show that it is linked.

Note: Model 3 supports up to 10 driver profiles. You can link multiple keys to a driver profile, but you cannot link multiple driver profiles to a single key.


## Easy Entry

You can define an Easy Entry setting that moves the steering wheel and driver's seat to make it easy to enter and exit Model 3. Any driver can use the Easy Entry setting by associating it with their driver profile. When the Easy Entry setting is associated with a driver profile, the steering wheel and driver's seat automatically adjust when in Park and the driver's seat belt is unbuckled, allowing an easy exit from Model 3. When returning to the vehicle and stepping on the brake pedal, settings automatically adjust back to the settings used by the most recent driver profile (or based on the key if it's linked to a driver profile).

To use Easy Entry with a driver profile, ensure the Use Easy Entry box is checked.

Warning: Never use Easy Entry to move the driver's seat to the full rearward position when a child safety seat is installed on a rear seat located behind the driver's seat. With reduced clearance, the movement of the seat may impact a child's legs, cause injury, or dislodge the seat.


## Valet Mode

When Model 3 is in Valet mode, the following restrictions apply:
- Key card must be used to access and drive Model 3.
- Speed is limited to 70 mph (113 km/h).
- Maximum acceleration and power are limited.
- Front trunk and glovebox are locked.
- Home and Work locations are not available in the navigation system.
- Voice commands are disabled.
- Autopilot convenience features are disabled.
- The Allow Mobile Access setting cannot be changed.
- HomeLink (if available in your market region) is not accessible.
- Driver Profiles are not accessible.
- Some apps, such as Toybox and Theater, are not accessible.
- The touchscreen does not display the list of keys that can access Model 3 (see Managing Keys).
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are disabled. When Model 3 is in Valet mode, you cannot pair new Bluetooth devices or view or delete existing paired devices. However, if a Bluetooth-paired device or a known Wi-Fi network is within range, Model 3 connects to it.


## Starting Valet Mode

With Model 3 in Park, touch the driver profile icon at the top of the Controls screen, then touch Valet Mode.

The first time you enter Valet mode, the touchscreen prompts you to create a 4-digit PIN you will use to cancel Valet mode.

When Valet mode is active, the touchscreen displays the word Valet while the driver profile changes to Valet Mode on the touchscreen.

You can also use the mobile app to start and cancel Valet mode (if Model 3 is in Park). When using the mobile app, you do not need to enter a PIN because you are already required to log into the app using your Tesla Account credentials.

Note: If the PIN to Drive setting is enabled (see PIN to Drive), you must enter the driving PIN before you can define or enter a Valet PIN. Once in Valet mode, Model 3 can be driven without the valet needing to enter the driving PIN.

Note: The PIN to Drive setting is not available when Valet mode is active.

If you forget your valet PIN, reset it from inside Model 3 by entering your Tesla Account credentials (which also cancels Valet mode). You can also reset your PIN using the mobile app.


## Canceling Valet Mode

With Model 3 in Park, touch the Valet Mode driver profile icon at the top of the Controls screen, and enter your 4-digit PIN.

When you cancel Valet mode, all settings associated with the most recently used driver profile and climate control settings are restored, and all features are available.

Note: You do not need to enter a PIN to cancel Valet mode from the mobile app.
