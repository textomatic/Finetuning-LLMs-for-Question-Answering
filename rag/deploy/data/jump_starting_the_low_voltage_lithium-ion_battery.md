# Jump Starting the Low Voltage (Lithium-Ion) Battery

Vehicles manufactured in Gigafactory Shanghai after approximately October 2021, and in the Fremont Factory after approximately December 2021, are equipped with a Lithium-Ion low voltage battery.

1. Open the hood (see Opening Hood with No Power).
2. Remove the maintenance panel by pulling it upwards to release the trim clips that hold it in place.
3. Remove the red cover and connect the external low voltage power supply’s red positive (+) cable to the red positive (+) jump post.
CAUTION: To avoid damaging the vehicle, do not allow the positive cable to contact other metal components.
4. Connect the external low voltage power supply’s black negative (-) cable to the bolt located between the brake fluid reservoir and the front trunk. The bolt is used as a grounding location for the external support.
5. Turn on the external power supply (refer to the manufacturer’s instructions) for 20 seconds only, then switch off or disconnect the power supply.
CAUTION: If you leave the power supply on for longer than 20 seconds, the low voltage battery may not self-recover and the vehicle might not be able to shift into Drive. If this occurs, after disconnecting the power supply, disconnect the low voltage battery, then reconnect the low voltage battery to enable another battery self-recovery attempt.
Note: If attempting to activate Transport Mode (to winch the vehicle onto a flatbed truck), the low voltage battery is not required to self-recover. Leave the power supply connected continuously until the vehicle has been secured.
6. Open the driver door and wait two minutes.
7. Ensure the vehicle is able to shift into Drive.
8. Replace the maintenance panel by placing it back in its original location and pressing down until it is secure.
9. Close the hood.
