# Autopark

This feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until it is enabled with a future software update for vehicles manufactured as of approximately October 2022.

Note: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Autopark.

Autopark uses data to simplify parking on public roads by maneuvering Model 3 into parallel and perpendicular parking spaces.

CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance.

Warning: Autopark's performance depends on the ability of the cameras and sensors (if equipped) to determine the vehicle's proximity to curbs, objects, and other vehicles.

Warning: Do not use Autopark if anything, such as a ball hitch, bike rack, or trailer, is attached to the tow hitch. Autopark may not stop for hitches when parking between or in front of other vehicles.


## Parameters

Autopark detects potential parking spaces based on the following parameters:

Perpendicular Parking: 
- Your driving speed must be below 8 mph (13 km/h). If driving too fast, Autopark may not be able to accurately detect your desired parking space.
- The parking space must be at least 7.2 feet (2.2 meters) wide.
- The parking space must have at least three visible lines for the vehicle to park into, such as parking lines, road markings, or distinct curbs. Autopark may not work in a garage, for example, without three visible parking lines.
- Autopark may not work with textured road surfaces such as cobblestone or brick.

Parallel Parking: 
- Your driving speed must be below 13 mph (21 km/h). If driving too fast, Autopark may not be able to accurately detect your desired parking space.
- There must be a vehicle in front of the space you want to park in.
- A distinct curb or edge must be visible. Autopark may not correctly identify the parking space if the curb is not distinct, such as grass or dirt.

Note: Autopark does not operate on angled parking spaces.


## To Use Autopark

When driving, follow these steps to allow Autopark to maneuver Model 3 into a parking space:
1. While driving slowly, monitor the touchscreen to see potential parking spaces detected by Autopilot. When Model 3 is positioned such that it can reverse into one of the detected locations, the touchscreen displays a parking icon.
Note: The parking icon appears only if the vehicle's position and/or the circumstances of the surrounding area are such that Autopark can determine an appropriate driving path. If Autopark cannot determine an appropriate path (for example, when driving on a narrow street where moving into the parking space causes the front of the vehicle to extend into the adjacent lane), you can either reposition the vehicle, find a different parking space, or park manually.
2. Choose a spot, check to determine if it is appropriate and safe, then pull forward and stop approximately one car length ahead of the parking space (as you normally would when parallel parking or when backing into a perpendicular parking space).
3. Release the steering wheel, shift Model 3 into Reverse, then touch Start Autopark on the touchscreen.
4. Autopark displays a message when parking is complete.

If you press the brake pedal when Autopark is actively parking Model 3, the parking process pauses until you touch Resume on the touchscreen.

Warning: Never depend on Autopark to find a parking space that is legal, suitable, and safe. Autopark may not always detect objects in the parking space. Always perform visual checks to confirm that a parking space is appropriate and safe.

Warning: When Autopark is actively steering Model 3:
- Do not interfere with the movement of the steering wheel. Doing so cancels Autopark.
- Continually check your surroundings. Be prepared to apply the brakes to avoid vehicles, pedestrians, or objects.
- Monitor the touchscreen to ensure that you are aware of the instructions that Autopark is providing.


## To Pause Parking

To pause Autopark, press the brake pedal once. Model 3 stops and remains stopped until you touch Resume on the touchscreen.


## To Cancel Parking

Autopark cancels the parking sequence when you manually move the steering wheel, shift, or touch Cancel on the touchscreen. Autopark also cancels parking when:
- The parking sequence exceeds seven moves.
- Model 3 detects that the driver is exiting the vehicle.
- A door is opened.
- You press the accelerator pedal.
- You press the brake pedal while Autopark is paused.
- An Automatic Emergency Braking event occurs (see Collision Avoidance Assist).
