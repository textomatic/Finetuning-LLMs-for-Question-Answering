# Replacing Hood Struts

Your hood struts can be replaced if they begin to fail for any reason. To replace your hood struts:
1. Open the hood and use a non-marring prop to temporarily support it.
2. Use a trim tool to release the clip on the bottom of the strut and pull the strut off from the mount on the body of the vehicle.
3. Use a trim tool to release the clip on the top of the strut and pull the strut off from the mount on the hood. Remove the old strut from the vehicle.
4. Clean the mounting locations on the vehicle and then lubricate both pivot points of the new strut.
5. Secure the rod end of the strut to the body of the vehicle then the body end of the strut to the hood. Ensure the clips are secure.
6. Remove the hood prop and ensure the hood opens and closes as expected.
