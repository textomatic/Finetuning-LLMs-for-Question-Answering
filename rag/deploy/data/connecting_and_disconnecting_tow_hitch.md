# Connecting and Disconnecting Tow Hitch (Europe)

## Connecting the Tow Hitch

The Model 3 towing package includes a weight-carrying hitch with a 50 mm ball coupling. When not in use, the hitch should be removed and stored in a dry location to prevent rust and corrosion. Keep the dust cover over the hitch housing to prevent dirt and debris from entering.

Warning: You must use the Model 3 trailer hitch when towing a trailer. Never attempt to attach a different type of trailer hitch.

Note: Always attach safety chains when towing. Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and attach to the trailer eyelets to ensure the security of the trailer load.

Note: The maximum permissible rear overhang for the coupling point is 1053 mm.

Note: The trailer hitch assembly is attached to the body of the vehicle with 6 nuts.

To install the trailer hitch:
1. Remove the dust cover from the hitch housing by inserting a small object, such as a flat screwdriver, into the push clips on each side of the dust cover. Turn the push clips until they are in an unclasped position, take them out, and remove the dust cover.
2. Insert the key into the locking cylinder on the hitch, and turn the cylinder so the top of the key is aligned with the “Open” position.
3. Pull the locking cylinder out of the adapter approximately 0.5 cm, and turn clockwise until the Unlock icon is fixated at the top of the locking cylinder.
CAUTION: Be careful when turning the locking cylinder. If it does not lock into the "Open" position, it automatically retracts into its original "Closed" position and can pinch your fingers.
4. Firmly grasp the hitch from the bottom and align with the corresponding cutouts in the hitch housing.
Note: Do not grasp the locking cylinder because it needs to rotate freely.
5. Push the hitch into the hitch housing until the locking cylinder quickly rotates counter-clockwise and automatically locks into the "Closed" position.
6. Check to confirm that the hitch is fully inserted into the housing by pulling down on the hitch. The hitch should not drop when you pull down.
Note: If the hitch does not lock into the housing, it falls out when you pull down on the hitch.
7. Turn the key so the arrows align with the Lock icon on the locking cylinder.
8. Remove the key and store it in a safe place (preferably inside the vehicle).
Note: The key can be removed only if the hitch is locked. This indicates a proper connection. Do not use the hitch if the key is not removed.
Note: Tesla recommends making a note of the key code. You need this key code if you lose the keys and need to order a replacement.
Note: The trailer hitch is attached to the body of the vehicle with 6 bolts.


## Disconnecting the Tow Hitch

After towing, remove the hitch:
1. Insert the key and turn to align the top of the key with the Unlock icon.
2. While firmly holding the bottom of the hitch (to prevent it from dropping to the ground), pull the locking cylinder out approximately 0.5 cm, and turn it clockwise until the Lock icon shifts to the top. At this point, the locking cylinder is unlocked in the "Open" position and the hitch drops out of the housing.
Warning: Be careful when turning the locking cylinder. If it does not lock into the "Open" position, it automatically retracts into its original "Closed" position and can pinch your fingers.
3. Reinstall the dust cover on the hitch housing to prevent dirt from accumulating inside the housing by snapping in the push clips.
4. Close the dust cover on the hitch's locking cylinder and store the hitch in a secure location.
Note: To maintain the hitch, regularly grease its surface with non-resinous grease.
