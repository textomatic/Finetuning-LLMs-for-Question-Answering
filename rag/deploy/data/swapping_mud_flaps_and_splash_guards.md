# Swapping Mud Flaps and Splash Guards

Perform the following to swap the mud flaps and splash guards:
1. Turn the steering wheel fully to the left to provide access to the working area.
2. Remove the bolt that secures the bottom of the mud flap to the lower rocker panel cover.
3. 2nd GENERATION KITS: Carefully use a flathead screwdriver to open the push clips (pull the plastic rivet out), and then remove the push clips that secure the mud flap or splash guard to the wheel arch liner.
4. 1st GENERATION KITS: Remove the screws and washers that secure the mud flap or splash guard to the U-nuts in the wheel arch liner.
5. Remove the mud flap or splash guard from the vehicle.
6. IF INSTALLING SPLASH GUARDS: Clean the mud flap with alcohol and allow to fully dry. Then remove the adhesive backing from the splash guard, and then align the splash guard with the mud flap so that the holes are aligned. Once aligned, apply pressure along the mud flap to ensure it is adhered to the splash guard.
Note: Use new adhesive tape if the splash guards were released from the mud flaps previously.
7. IF REMOVING SPLASH GUARDS: Pull the splash guard away from the mud flap to release the adhesive tape. Clean the mud flap and splash guard with alcohol and allow to fully dry.
CAUTION: Splash guards are recommended if you drive on roads where salt, sand, or gravel are commonly used to improve road conditions.
8. 2nd GENERATION KITS: Align the holes in the mud flap/splash guard to the holes in the front wheel arch liner, and then insert the opened (plastic rivet pulled out) push clips into the holes. Once the push clips are fully inserted, push the plastic rivets in to close the push clips and lock the mud flap/splash guard in place.
9. 1st GENERATION KITS: Place the washers over the screws (x2), and then install the screws to secure the mud flap/splash guard to the U-nuts in the front wheel arch liner. Tighten the screws to 1.5 Nm (1 ft-lbs).
10. Install the bolt that secures the bottom of the mud flap to the lower rocker panel cover. Tighten the bolt to 5 Nm (4 ft-lbs).
11. Perform this procedure again on the right side of the vehicle.
