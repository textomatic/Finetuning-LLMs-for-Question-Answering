## Adjusting Steering Effort

You can adjust the feel and sensitivity of the steering system to suit your personal preference:
1. On the touchscreen, touch Controls > Pedals & Steering > Steering Mode.
2. Choose a steering option:
- Comfort - Reduces the effort required to turn the steering wheel. In town, Model 3 feels easier to drive and park.
- Standard - Tesla believes that this setting offers the best handling and response in most conditions.
- Sport - Increases the effort required to turn the steering wheel. When driving at higher speeds, Model 3 feels more responsive.


## Scroll Buttons

A scroll button is located on each side of the steering wheel. Use your thumb to press this button to the right or left. You can also press the button or roll it up or down.
