# Autopilot Features

This topic describes how to enable and use the following driver assistance features.
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control: Like traditional cruise control, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control maintains a set driving speed. However, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control also slows down or accelerates Model 3 as needed to maintain the following distance from the vehicle in front of you. While Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is engaged, you are still responsible for steering Model 3 (see Traffic-Aware Cruise Control).
- Autosteer: Like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer maintains a set speed (if there is not a vehicle in front of you) or a set following distance (if there is a vehicle in front of you). In addition, Autosteer detects lane markings, road edges, and the presence of vehicles and objects to intelligently keep Model 3 in its driving lane (see Autosteer).
Note: Autosteer is a BETA feature.
- Auto Lane Change: When you engage a turn signal while Autosteer is active, Auto Lane Change moves Model 3 into the adjacent lane in the direction indicated by the turn signal (see Auto Lane Change).
- Navigate on Autopilot: Navigate on Autopilot builds on the features of Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer. While Autosteer is active, Navigate on Autopilot allows Model 3 to suggest and, if configured, automatically change lanes to pass other vehicles and follow the navigation route (see Navigate on Autopilot).
Note: Navigate on Autopilot is a BETA feature.

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer use information from the cameras on Model 3 to detect lane markings, road edges, and other vehicles and road users around Model 3.

CAUTION: Before using Autopilot features, ensure that all cameras are clean and free of obstructions (see GUID-65384C1F-86F2-44E8-A8BC-8A12E7E00A40.html#D1E9186). Dirty cameras and sensors (if equipped), as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, affect Autopilot performance.

CAUTION: It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Autopilot and the situations in which driver intervention may be needed. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings.


## Autopilot Settings

Before you use Autopilot features, customize how they work by touching Controls > Autopilot.
- Set Speed: Choose whether Autopilot engages at the currently detected speed limit or your current driving speed. Touch Controls > Autopilot > Set Speed and choose either Speed Limit or Current Speed.
- Offset: If you choose Speed Limit, you can specify an offset by touching Set Speed Offset. You can choose Fixed (the cruising speed adjusts by a specific amount on all roads) or Percentage (the cruising speed is adjusted as a percentage of the road's detected speed limit).
- Green Traffic Light Chime: In Canada and U.S.: If on, a chime will sound when you are waiting at a red traffic light and the light turns green. If you are not actively using Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and are waiting at a red light with a car in front of you, the chime sounds when the car ahead of you advances.


## Traffic-Aware Cruise Control

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is always enabled.

When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is available but not engaged, the touchscreen displays the cruising speed in gray. The number shown represents the speed that will be set when you engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control.

When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is actively cruising at a set speed, the speed is highlighted with blue text.

To engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control when it is available (the car status area of the touchscreen displays the gray cruising speed icon), move the drive stalk down once, then release the accelerator pedal to allow Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to maintain the cruising speed. You can apply the accelerator at any time to temporarily override the set cruising speed.

If you want a chime to sound when you engage or cancel Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, touch Controls > Autopilot > Traffic-Aware Cruise Control Chime.

Warning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is designed for your driving comfort and convenience and is not a collision warning or avoidance system. It is your responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Never depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately slow down Model 3. Always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings.


## Autosteer

Note: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Autosteer, or the feature may not operate exactly as described.

To enable Autosteer:
1. Touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Features > Autosteer (Beta).
2. After carefully reading and understanding the popup window, touch Yes.
Icon of a gray steering wheel.

To indicate that Autosteer is available (but not actively steering Model 3), the top corner of the touchscreen displays a gray Autosteer icon next to the driving gear. In situations where Autosteer is temporarily unavailable, the Autosteer icon disappears. (For example, if your driving speed is not within the speed required for Autosteer to operate.)

To indicate that Autosteer is now active, the touchscreen displays the Autosteer icon in blue. When Autosteer is able to detect lane markings, it also displays the driving lane in blue.

To initiate Autosteer, move the drive stalk fully down twice in quick succession.

Autosteer confirms activation with an audible chime and briefly displays a message on the touchscreen reminding you to pay attention to the road and be ready to take over at any time.

Whenever Autosteer is active, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is active as well.

In situations where the speed limit cannot be detected when Autosteer is engaged, Autosteer reduces your driving speed and limits the set cruising speed to 45 mph (70 km/h). Although you can manually accelerate to exceed the limited speed, Model 3 will not brake for detected obstacles as long as you are applying the accelerator pedal. Autosteer slows down to the limited speed when you release the accelerator pedal. When you leave the road or disengage Autosteer by using the steering wheel, you can increase your set speed again, if desired.

Warning: Autosteer is a hands-on assistance feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Autosteer and the situations in which it may not work as expected. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings.


## Auto Lane Change

If you engage a turn signal while Autosteer is active, Model 3 moves into the adjacent lane in the direction indicated by the turn signal, provided the following conditions are met:
- The turn signal is engaged.
- Lane markings indicate that a lane change is permitted.
- Midway through the lane change, Model 3 must detect the target lane's outside lane marking. If this lane marking is not detected, the lane change is aborted and Model 3 returns to its original driving lane.
- The view of the camera(s) is not obstructed.
- Model 3 does not detect a vehicle in its blind spot, or a vehicle or obstacle up to the center of the target lane. If a vehicle or other obstacle is detected in the target lane, it is shown in red in the visualization on the touchscreen and Model 3 does not complete the lane change until it is safe to do so.

Warning: Although Autopilot is designed to detect vehicles and obstacles in adjacent lanes, it is your responsibility to always perform visual checks to make sure it is safe and appropriate to move into the target lane. If Autopilot cannot change lanes due to inadequate data, the touchscreen displays a series of warnings. Therefore, when using Auto Lane Change, always pay attention to the touchscreen and be prepared to manually steer Model 3.

The minimum speed at which Autopilot changes lanes may vary depending on region, adjacent lane speeds, and other factors. Always be ready to manually steer and change lanes as necessary. When an automatic lane change is in progress, Overtake Acceleration is activated, allowing Model 3 to accelerate closer to a vehicle in front (see Overtake Acceleration).

When you engage a turn signal, Autopilot moves Model 3 one lane at a time. Moving into an additional lane requires you to engage the turn signal a second time after the first lane change is complete.

As Model 3 changes lanes, it is important to monitor its performance by watching the driving path in front of you and the surrounding area. Stay prepared to take over steering at any time. As you are crossing over into the adjacent lane, the touchscreen displays the location in the lane that Model 3 is moving into.


## Navigate on Autopilot

Note: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Navigate on Autopilot, or the feature may not operate exactly as described.

To enable Navigate on Autopilot, touch Controls > Autopilot > Navigate on Autopilot (Beta). Then, to customize how you want Navigate on Autopilot to operate, touch Customize Navigate on Autopilot:
- Enable at Start of Every Trip: Choose whether to automatically enable Navigate on Autopilot for every navigation route. When enabled, the Navigate on Autopilot button on the turn-by-turn direction list is already enabled at the start of every trip.
- Speed Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot is designed to perform both route-based and speed-based lane changes. Speed-based lanes changes are optional. You can use this setting to disable speed-based lane changes or to specify how assertively you want Navigate on Autopilot to change lanes to achieve the set cruising speed (Mild, Average, or Mad Max).
- Exit Passing Lane: Choose whether you want Navigate on Autopilot to maneuver out of a passing lane when navigating to a destination. In addition to route-based and speed-based lane changes, Navigate on Autopilot requests a lane change out of a passing lane as a reminder to stay in a slower lane when you are not passing other vehicles. Choose No to disable this and keep Model 3 in a passing lane except when needed to stay on the navigation route.
- Require Lane Change Confirmation: (if equipped) By default, Navigate on Autopilot requires your confirmation before proceeding with a lane change by engaging the appropriate turn signal. If you do not confirm the lane change within 3 seconds, a chime sounds to remind you that Navigate on Autopilot requires your confirmation to change lanes.
- Lane Change Notification: You can specify if or how you want to be notified of lane changes (Off, Chime, Vibrate, or Both).

If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned on, Navigate on Autopilot engages automatically when:
- Autosteer is active.
- You are navigating to a destination.
- You are on a controlled-access highway.

Once enabled, the Navigate on Autopilot button appears on the map’s turn-by-turn direction list whenever a navigation route is active and the route includes at least one controlled-access highway.

If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned off, touch the Navigate on Autopilot button above the turn-by-turn directions to enable it. Once the Navigate on Autopilot is selected, it will engage whenever you engage Autosteer.

The Navigate on Autopilot icon shows in the turn-by-turn direction list when you are navigating to a destination and Navigate on Autopilot is available but not active.

If Navigate on Autopilot is active, the icon is blue. If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned on, the Navigate on Autopilot icon is selected whenever you start navigation. Touch the icon to cancel Navigate on Autopilot and revert to Autosteer.

Whenever Navigate on Autopilot is active, the Navigate on Autopilot button is blue and the touchscreen displays the driving lane as a single blue line in front of Model 3:

The turn-by-turn directions display the Autosteer icon next to the maneuvers (such as off-ramps) that Navigate on Autopilot will handle.

When Navigate on Autopilot is engaged, Model 3 automatically makes both speed-based and route-based lane changes:
- Speed Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot changes lanes to reduce driving time to your destination. For example, if Model 3 is behind a vehicle going below the set cruising speed, Navigate on Autopilot will move into the passing lane to pass it. Speed-based lanes changes are optional.
- Route Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot changes lanes to route you to your destination. For example, Navigate on Autopilot will move into the exit lane as Model 3 approaches the off-ramp specified by the navigation route.

If you ignore a route-based lane change suggestion (for example, you are driving in the left lane while approaching an off-ramp on the right side of the highway), Navigate on Autopilot is unable to maneuver onto the off-ramp and as a result, you are re-routed to your destination.

Note: When determining navigation routes, and maneuvers at interchanges, Navigate on Autopilot considers whether or not you want to use High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. Therefore, ensure the Use HOV Lanes setting is appropriate for your circumstances (see Maps and Navigation). If the setting is off, Navigate on Autopilot never uses a HOV lane, regardless of time of day. If the setting is on, Navigate on Autopilot uses HOV lanes, whenever applicable.

CAUTION: Navigate on Autopilot may not always attempt to exit at an off-ramp or change lanes, even when an exit or lane change is determined by the navigation route. Always remain alert and be prepared to manually steer onto an off-ramp, or make a lane change to prepare for, or to exit at, an off-ramp or interchange.

Navigate on Autopilot activates and deactivates based on the type of road you are driving on. When Navigate on Autopilot is active and you approach an off-ramp or interchange along your navigation route, the appropriate turn signal engages and Autosteer maneuvers Model 3 onto the off-ramp or interchange.

When you leave a controlled-access highway Navigate on Autopilot reverts to Autosteer—a chime sounds and the touchscreen displays the driving lane lines in blue (instead of the single blue in front of Model 3). When Navigate on Autopilot deactivates, Autosteer remains active. Always be prepared to take appropriate action.

Warning: Navigate on Autopilot is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Navigate on Autopilot and the situations in which it may not work as expected. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings.


## Canceling Autopilot

Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cancels when:
- You move the drive stalk upward.
CAUTION: If you move the drive stalk upward and hold it up for more than one second, Model 3 shifts into Neutral after canceling Autosteer.
- You press the brake pedal.
- You exceed 90 mph (150 km/h).
- You shift into Reverse, Park, or Neutral.
- A door is opened.
- An Automatic Emergency Braking event occurs (see Collision Avoidance Assist).
- The driver's seatbelt is released, and/or the driver gets out of their seat.

When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cancels, the cruising speed icon on the touchscreen turns gray to indicate that Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is no longer active.

Autosteer cancels when any of the above actions are taken. In addition, Autosteer cancels when:
- You exceed 85 mph (140 km/h).
- You take over steering manually.
Note: If Autosteer cancels because you started steering manually, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control remains active.
- You do not respond to repeated reminders to keep your hands on the wheel and subsequent messages on the touchscreen (see Driver Attentiveness).

When Autosteer cancels, a chime sounds and the Autosteer icon either turns gray to indicate that Autosteer is no longer active, or disappears to indicate that it is not currently available.

Navigate on Autopilot cancels when Autosteer cancels, as described above. In addition, Navigate on Autopilot cancels when:
- You touch the Navigate on Autopilot button on the map’s turn-by-turn direction list. In this case, Autosteer is still active.
- You leave a controlled-access highway. When this happens, Autosteer is still active.

When Navigate on Autopilot cancels but Autosteer remains active, a chime sounds and the visualization goes from a single blue line in the driving lane to two blue lines on either side of the lane.

When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer cancels, Model 3 does not coast. Instead, regenerative braking slows down Model 3 in the same way as when you move your foot off the accelerator when driving without Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (see Regenerative Braking).


## While Using Autopilot

When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is active and Autopilot is maintaining a set speed, the speed is highlighted with blue text on the touchscreen.

When Autosteer is active, the steering wheel icon is blue and the lane markings are highlighted in blue on the visualization. If Navigate on Autopilot is also active, the Navigate on Autopilot button is blue and the touchscreen displays the driving lane as a single blue line in front of Model 3.

To display more details about the roadway and its surroundings, such as road markings, stop lights, and objects (such as trash cans and poles), touch Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving Visualization Preview.

If unable to detect lane markings, Autosteer may determine the driving lane based on a vehicle you are following. In most cases, Autosteer attempts to center Model 3 in the driving lane. However, there may be situations in which Autosteer follows a driving path that is offset from the center of the lane (for example, if guard rails are detected).


## Maintaining the Set Speed

When Autopilot is active, Model 3 maintains your set cruising speed whenever a vehicle is not detected in front of it. When cruising behind a vehicle, Model 3 accelerates and decelerates as needed to maintain a chosen following distance (see Adjusting the Following Distance), up to the set speed.

You can manually accelerate at any time by pressing the accelerator pedal, but when you release the pedal Model 3 resumes cruising at the set speed.

Model 3 also adjusts the cruising speed when entering and exiting curves.
When Model 3 is actively slowing down to maintain the selected distance from the vehicle ahead, brake lights turn on. You may notice slight movement of the brake pedal. However, when Model 3 is accelerating, the accelerator pedal does not move.


## Changing the Set Speed

Roll the right scroll wheel up to increase, or down to decrease, the set speed.
You can also change the cruising speed to the current speed limit (including any offset you've specified), by either:
- Pushing the drive stalk downward and briefly holding.
- Touching and briefly holding the speed limit sign on the touchscreen until you see the cruising speed change.

It may take a few seconds for Model 3 to reach the new cruising speed.


## Adjusting the Following Distance

To adjust the following distance you want to maintain between Model 3 and a vehicle traveling ahead of you, press the steering wheel's right scroll button to the left or right.

Note: If Full Self-Driving (Beta) is active, pressing the steering wheel's right scroll button to the left or right changes the Full Self-Driving (Beta) profile (see Full Self-Driving (Beta)).

The closest following distance is 2.

Each setting corresponds to a time-based distance that represents how long it takes for Model 3, from its current location, to reach the location of the rear bumper of the vehicle ahead of you. Autopilot retains your setting until you change it again.

As you adjust the following distance, the touchscreen displays the current setting.


## Stopping and Slowdowns

When moving significantly faster than vehicles in adjacent lanes, Model 3 automatically reduces the driving speed. This is especially helpful in heavy traffic situations or when vehicles are constantly merging into different lanes. When Model 3 detects other vehicles driving significantly slower, the touchscreen highlights the adjacent lanes with arrows and detected vehicles in gray, and Model 3 reduces the driving speed as appropriate. To temporarily override this feature, press the accelerator pedal.

When following a vehicle, Autopilot remains active at low speeds, even when Model 3 comes to a full stop. For example, Autopilot remains active even if Model 3 slows down to a complete or near-complete stop in heavy, stop-and-go traffic on a highway. When traffic starts moving more rapidly, Autopilot again accelerates up to the set speed.
Sometimes when Model 3 is at a full stop, Autopilot goes into a HOLD state. If this happens, briefly press the accelerator pedal to resume cruising.

Icon of an "H" inside a circle with half circles on each side of the circle: When the HOLD status is active, the touchscreen displays the HOLD icon and a message that indicates that you need to resume cruise control.

Model 3 goes into HOLD state while Autopilot is active in the following circumstances:
- Model 3 has been at a standstill for 5 minutes.
- Model 3 detects a pedestrian (the HOLD state may clear when the pedestrian is no longer detected).
- Model 3 suddenly loses visibility of the vehicle in front of you.
- An obstacle is detected in front of Model 3.


## Cruising Near or On Exits

When you are cruising near an exit on a controlled-access highway and engage the turn signal toward the off-ramp, Autopilot assumes you are exiting and begins to slow down Model 3. If you do not drive onto the off-ramp, Autopilot resumes cruising at the set speed.

In a region with right hand traffic, this occurs only when you engage the right turn signal when driving in the right-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters) of an exit. Likewise in regions with left hand traffic, this occurs when engaging the left turn signal when driving in the left-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters) of an exit.

Note: If Navigate on Autopilot is active, Model 3 will perform a route-based lane change to enter the exit lane and take the off-ramp as necessary to follow the navigation route.

When enabled while on a highway interchange or off-ramp, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may reduce your set speed in 5 mph (5 km/h) increments – to as slow as 25 mph (40 km/h) – to better match the reported speeds of other Tesla vehicles that have driven at that specific location. To override this and continue cruising at your set speed, tap the accelerator pedal. The new set speed is maintained for the duration of the interchange or off-ramp (unless you override it or cancel Autopilot). After the interchange or off-ramp, the set speed may revert or change as necessary based on the new location. For example, if you merged onto a different highway, the set cruising speed reverts to what it was before driving on the interchange.

Warning: In some cases (such as having insufficient data), Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not automatically reduce the set speed on the highway interchange or off-ramp. Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to determine an appropriate driving speed. Tesla recommends driving at a speed that is safe for road conditions and within posted speed limits.

When cruising onto an on-ramp to a controlled-access highway, Autopilot automatically adjusts the set cruising speed to the speed limit of the highway, plus any offset you have specified. If Navigate on Autopilot is engaged, it disengages as you leave the controlled-access highway (see Canceling Autopilot). In this case, Autosteer remains active.


## Overtake Acceleration

Engage the turn signal momentarily to accelerate Model 3 towards the vehicle ahead of it. By momentarily holding the turn signal stalk up or down, you can quickly accelerate up to your set speed without having to press the accelerator pedal as long as:
- Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is operating and detects a vehicle in front of you.
- No obstacles or vehicles are detected in the target lane.
- Model 3 is traveling below the set speed, but over 45 mph (72 km/h).

Note: If Autosteer is active and you fully engage the turn signal, Model 3 will change lanes automatically (see Auto Lane Change).

Model 3 stops accelerating when you reach your set cruising speed, if changing lanes takes too long, or if Model 3 gets too close the vehicle ahead. Model 3 also stops accelerating if you disengage the turn signal.


## Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning

While Autopilot is in use, Model 3 displays a warning on the touchscreen and sounds a chime if it detects that you are likely to run through a red stop light or stop sign. If this happens, TAKE IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION!

The visual and audible warnings cancel after a few seconds or when you press the brake pedal, whichever comes first.

Stop Light and Stop Sign Warning provides warnings only. It does not slow down or stop Model 3 at red traffic lights, stop signs, road markings, etc. If equipped with Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, you can enable this feature to automatically stop Model 3 at traffic lights and stop signs (see Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control).


## Emergency Vehicles

If available in your market region, Model 3 automatically reduces driving speed when lights from an emergency vehicle are detected when using Autosteer at night on a high speed road. When this happens, the touchscreen displays a message informing you of the slowdown. You will also hear a chime, and see a reminder to keep your hands on the steering wheel. When the light detections pass by or cease to appear, Autopilot resumes your cruising speed. Alternatively, you may tap the accelerator to resume your cruising speed.

Never depend on Autopilot features to determine the presence of emergency vehicles. Model 3 may not detect lights from emergency vehicles. Keep your eyes on your driving path and always be prepared to take immediate action.


## Driver Attentiveness

Autosteer determines how best to steer Model 3. When active, Autosteer requires you to hold the steering wheel. If it does not detect your hands on the steering wheel for a period of time, a flashing blue light appears at the top of the car status section of the touchscreen and the following message displays: Apply slight turning force to steering wheel

When your hands are detected, the message disappears and Autosteer resumes normal operation. Autosteer detects your hands by recognizing slight resistance as the steering wheel turns, or from you manually turning the steering wheel very lightly (without enough force to take over steering). Autosteer also qualifies your hands as being detected if you engage a turn signal or use a button or scroll wheel on the steering wheel.

Autosteer requires that you pay attention to your surroundings and remain prepared to take control at any time. If Autosteer still does not detect your hands on the steering wheel, the flashing light on the car status section of the touchscreen increases in frequency and a chime sounds.

If you repeatedly ignore Autosteer's prompts to apply slight force to the steering wheel, Autosteer disables for the rest of the drive and displays the following message requesting you to drive manually: Autosteer unavailable for the rest of this drive. Hold steering wheel to drive manually.

For the rest of the drive, you must steer manually. Autosteer is available again on your next drive (after you stop and shift Model 3 into Park).

If you don't resume manual steering, Autosteer sounds a continuous chime, turns on the warning flashers, and slows the vehicle to a complete stop.

In situations where Autosteer is unable to steer Model 3, Autosteer sounds a warning chime and displays the following message on the touchscreen: Take over immediately

When you see this message, TAKE OVER STEERING IMMEDIATELY.
