# Maintenance Service Intervals

## Service Intervals

Tesla recommends the following maintenance items and intervals, as applicable to your vehicle, to ensure continued reliability and efficiency of your Model 3.

For more do-it-yourself maintenance procedures and information, see https://www.tesla.com/support/do-it-yourself-guides.

For more information on vehicle alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts.
- Brake fluid health check every 4 years (replace if necessary)**.
- A/C desiccant bag replacement every 4* years.
- Cabin air filter replacement every 2 years (or 3 years for HEPA and carbon filters, if equipped)
- Clean and lubricate brake calipers every year or 12,500 miles (20,000 km) if in an area where roads are salted during winter.
- Rotate tires every 6,250 miles (10,000 km) or if tread depth difference is 2/32 in (1.5 mm) or greater, whichever comes first.

*A/C desiccant bag replacement can be extended to 6 years on vehicles manufactured between approximately 2017-2021.

**Heavy brake usage due to towing, mountain descents, or performance driving -- especially for vehicles in hot and humid environments -- may necessitate more frequent brake fluid checks and replacements.

Note: Any damage caused by opening the Battery coolant reservoir is excluded from the warranty.

Note: The above intervals are based on typical driving behaviors and scenarios. Depending on various circumstances such as driving behavior, usage, environmental conditions, etc., the above maintenance items may need to be replaced more or less frequently than specified. Additionally, the above list should not be considered comprehensive and does not include consumable parts such as windshield wipers, brake pads, low voltage battery (if applicable), etc.

Note: Damages or failures caused by maintenance or repairs performed by non-Tesla certified technicians are not covered by the warranty.


## Schedule Service

Scheduling a service visit through the mobile app is easy. After touching Schedule Service, select the type of service needed and follow the directions in the mobile app. Provide as much detail as possible, such as:
- Photos, sound recordings, or videos.
- Date(s), time(s), and time zone when the issue occurred.
- Country of use and location.
- Approximate speed the vehicle was traveling (if applicable).
- Environmental conditions (rain, snow, cold, etc.).
- Road name and type of road (if applicable).
- Quality of lane markings (if applicable).
- Applicable vehicle settings.
- Identifiable symptoms.

## Daily Checks

- Check the Battery’s charge level, displayed on the touchscreen or mobile app.
- Check the condition and pressure of each tire (see Tire Care and Maintenance).
- Check that all exterior lights, horn, turn signals, and wipers and washers are working.
- Check for any unexpected indicator lights or vehicle alerts on the touchscreen.
- Check the operation of the brakes, including the parking brake.
Note: Because Model 3 uses regenerative braking (see Regenerative Braking), the brake pads are typically used less frequently than those in traditional braking systems. To avoid the accumulation of rust and corrosion, Tesla recommends frequently pressing the brake pedal to apply the mechanical brakes, which dries the brake pads and rotors.
- Check the operation of the seat belts (see Seat Belts).
- Look for abnormal fluid deposits underneath Model 3 that might indicate a leak. It is normal for a small pool of water to form (caused by the air conditioning system’s dehumidifying process).
- Look around the exterior of Model 3 and immediately remove any corrosive substances (such as bird droppings, tree resin, tar spots, dead insects, industrial fallout, etc.) to prevent damage to the exterior (see Cleaning).


## Monthly Checks

- Check windshield washer fluid level and top up if necessary (see Topping Up Windshield Washer Fluid).
- Check that the air conditioning system is operating correctly (see Operating Climate Controls).

Note: In addition to cooling the interior, the air conditioning compressor also cools the Battery. Therefore, in hot weather, the air conditioning compressor can turn on even if you turned it off. This is normal because the system’s priority is to cool the Battery to ensure it stays within an optimum temperature range to support longevity and optimum performance. Also, even when not in use, you may hear Model 3 emit a whining noise or the sound of water circulating. These sounds are normal and occur when the internal cooling systems turn on to support various vehicle functions, such as maintaining the low voltage battery and balancing the temperature of the high voltage Battery.

Warning: Contact Tesla immediately if you notice any significant or sudden drop in fluid levels or uneven tire wear.


## Fluid Replacement Intervals

Battery coolant and brake fluid levels should only be checked by Tesla or a professional automotive repair shop. Specific service information is available in the Service Manual.
- Battery coolant: Your Battery coolant does not need to be replaced for the life of your vehicle under most circumstances.
Note: Any damage caused by opening the Battery coolant reservoir is excluded from the warranty.
- Brake fluid: Do not top up your brake fluid.


## Software

Updating software is important to ensure proper operation and longevity of your vehicle's components. You must install a software update at the earliest opportunity. See Software Updates.

Tesla may update or reinstall your vehicle's software as part of the normal diagnostic, repair, and maintenance process within Service.


## High Voltage Safety

Your Model 3 has been designed and built with safety as a priority. However, be aware of these precautions to protect yourself from the risk of injury inherent in all high-voltage systems:
- Read and follow all instructions provided on the labels that are attached to Model 3. These labels are there for your safety.
- The high voltage system has no user-serviceable parts. Do not disassemble, remove or replace high voltage components, cables or connectors. High voltage cables are colored orange for easy identification.
- If a collision occurs, do not touch any high voltage wiring, connectors, or components connected to the wiring.
- In the unlikely event that a fire occurs, immediately contact your local fire emergency responders.

Warning: Always disconnect the charge cable before working underneath Model 3, even if charging is not in progress.

Warning: Keep your hands and clothing away from cooling fans. Some fans operate even when Model 3 is powered off.

Warning: Some fluids (battery acid, Battery coolant, brake fluid, windshield washer additives, etc.) used in vehicles are poisonous and should not be inhaled, swallowed, or brought into contact with open wounds. For your safety, always read and follow instructions printed on fluid containers.


## Replacing the Low Voltage Battery

You can replace the low voltage battery yourself on some vehicles. See Replacing the Low Voltage Lead-Acid Battery for more information and procedure instructions.
