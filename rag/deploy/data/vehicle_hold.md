# Vehicle Hold

When Model 3 is stopped, Vehicle Hold can continue to apply the brakes even after you remove your foot from the brake pedal.

Vehicle Hold will activate:
- Hold: Vehicle Hold is automatically enabled any time the vehicle comes to a complete stop.
- Creep or Roll: Vehicle Hold is enabled automatically anytime the vehicle is at a standstill and the brake is pressed to the floor.

Gray icon of an "H" in a circle: This indicator displays on the touchscreen whenever Vehicle Hold is actively braking Model 3.

To disengage Vehicle Hold, press the accelerator pedal or press and release the brake pedal.

Note: Shifting into Neutral also disengages Vehicle Hold.

Note: After actively braking Model 3 for approximately ten minutes, Model 3 shifts into Park and Vehicle Hold cancels. Model 3 also shifts into Park if it detects that the driver has left the vehicle.
