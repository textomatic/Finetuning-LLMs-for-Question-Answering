# Mobile App

The Tesla mobile app allows you to communicate with Model 3 remotely using your iPhone® or Android™ phone.

Note: The information below may not represent an exhaustive list of the functions available on the Tesla mobile app. To ensure access to new and improved features, download updated versions of the mobile app as they become available.


## To Use the Mobile App

To set up the Tesla mobile app to communicate with your Model 3:
1. Download the Tesla mobile app to your phone.
2. Log in to the Tesla mobile app by entering your Tesla account credentials.
3. Enable mobile access to your Model 3 by touching Controls > Safety > Allow Mobile Access.
4. Turn your phone's Bluetooth setting ON and ensure that Bluetooth is turned on within your phone's global settings for the Tesla mobile app. For example, on your phone, navigate to Settings, choose the Tesla mobile app, and ensure the Bluetooth setting is enabled.

Your phone and vehicle must both be actively connected to cellular service to allow the mobile app to communicate with your vehicle. Tesla recommends that you always have a functional physical key readily available if parking in an area with limited or absent cellular service, such as an indoor parking garage.

Note: In the event that you require lockout assistance from Tesla due to a non-warranty issue, such as having limited cellular connectivity and having no secondary key available, your expenses are not covered under the Roadside Assistance policy.

Note: Tesla does not support the use of third party applications to contact Model 3.


## Overview

The Tesla mobile app's home screen allows you to:
- See the name of your vehicle (if you have one).
- View your vehicle’s estimated range.
- See which drive mode the vehicle is in (Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive).
- Lock or unlock your vehicle.
- Enable maximum defrost to warm your vehicle in cold conditions.
- Check your vehicle's charging information and open or close the charge port.
Note: Twisting red lines next to the battery icon indicate that the Battery is actively heating up (including while charging or preparing to charge).
- Open the front trunk.
- View your vehicle’s odometer, VIN, and current firmware version.

Media settings appear on the mobile app to pause, play, rewind, fast forward, and adjust the volume of the media currently playing in the vehicle.

For supported video sources, send videos to Tesla Theater by sharing the link through the mobile app. Navigate to the movie, show, or video you want to play on your phone and touch the share button. Share the video with the Tesla app and it appears on the touchscreen if Model 3 is in Park.


## Profile

In the Profile tab located at the top corner of your phone’s screen (shown as an avatar icon), you can:
- Switch to a different vehicle associated with your Tesla account, if you have access to more than one.
- Navigate the Tesla Shop.
- Manage your account information and view your order history.
- View and customize notifications you receive under the Settings tab, such as Calendar sync, when your security alarm has been triggered, charging updates, and new software updates. You can start updates from afar and check its progress.


## Controls

The Controls tab allows you to do the following:
- Open the front or rear trunk.
- Lock or unlock Model 3 from afar.
Note: Your vehicle does not automatically re-lock if you unlock from the mobile app.
- Open or close the charge port.
- Flash the lights or honk the horn to find where Model 3 is parked.
- Enable Keyless Driving.
Note: Keyless Driving can be used when you do not have your key or to bypass PIN to Drive in cases where you forgot your PIN or your touchscreen is unresponsive (see PIN to Drive).
- Open and close your garage door if your vehicle has a programmed HomeLink connection, if available (see Smart Garage).
- Vent the windows.


## Climate

You can check the interior temperature and heat or cool the cabin before driving (even if it’s in a garage), control the seat heaters, and defrost the windshield:
- Enable or disable Defrost Car, which helps melt snow, ice, and frost on the windshield, windows, and mirrors, by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.
- Enable or disable Dog Mode or Camp Mode.
- Enable Cabin Overheat Protection, which prevents the cabin from getting too warm in hot ambient conditions. You can choose whether you want the A/C or just the fan to run when the temperature in the cabin exceeds 105° F (40° C) or the selected temperature (if available). See Operating Climate Controls for more information.
- Vent or close the windows.

Using the mobile app to precondition Model 3 also warms the Battery as needed. The mobile app will notify you once your vehicle has reached the desired preconditioning temperature.

Note: In some vehicles, depending on vehicle specifications and date of manufacture, using the mobile app to defrost Model 3 also thaws ice on the charge port latch. This is useful in extremely cold weather or icy conditions in which the charge port latch can freeze in place, preventing you from removing or inserting the charge cable.


## Location

Locate Model 3 with directions, or track its movement across a map.


## Summon

You can park or retrieve Model 3 using Summon (see Summon) or Smart Summon (see Smart Summon).


## Schedule

Enable scheduled charging or departure, and precondition the vehicle. See Scheduled Charging and Scheduled Departure for more information.


## Security

The Security tab allows you to do the following:
- Pair your phone to the vehicle (see Phone Key).
- Enable or disable Sentry Mode (see How to Use Sentry Mode (Camera + App)).
- Enable or disable Valet Mode (see Valet Mode).
- Enable or disable Speed Limit Mode and receive notifications when the vehicle's driving speed is within approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) of your selected maximum speed (see Speed Limit Mode).
