# Lane Assist

Model 3 monitors the markers on the lane you are driving in as well as the surrounding areas for the presence of vehicles or other objects.

When an object is detected in your blind spot or near the side of Model 3 (such as a vehicle, guard rail, etc.), the touchscreen displays colored lines radiating from the image of your vehicle. The location of the lines correspond to the location of the detected object. The color of the lines (white, yellow, orange, or red) represent the object's proximity to Model 3, with white being the farthest and red being the closest and requiring your immediate attention. These colored lines only display when driving between approximately 7 and 85 mph (12 and 140 km/h). When Autosteer is active, these colored lines also display if driving slower than 7 mph (12 km/h). However, the colored lines do not display if Model 3 is at a standstill (for example, in heavy traffic).

CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance.

Warning: Lane Assist features are for guidance purposes only and is not intended to replace your own direct visual checks. Before changing lanes, always use side mirrors and perform the appropriate shoulder checks to visually determine if it is safe and appropriate to change lanes.

Warning: Never depend on Lane Assist to inform you if you unintentionally drive outside of the driving lane, or to inform you that there is a vehicle beside you or in your blind spot. Several external factors can reduce the performance of Lane Assist (see Limitations and Inaccuracies). It is the driver's responsibility to stay alert and pay attention to the driving lane and other road users. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.


## Steering Interventions

Lane Assist provides steering interventions if Model 3 drifts into (or close to) an adjacent lane in which an object, such as a vehicle, is detected. In these situations, Model 3 automatically steers to a safer position in the driving lane. This steering is applied only when Model 3 is traveling between 30 and 85 mph (48 and 140 km/h) on major roads with clearly visible lane markings. When a steering intervention is applied, the touchscreen briefly displays a warning message.


## Lane Departure Avoidance

Lane Departure Avoidance is designed to warn you if Model 3 is drifting out of, or nears the edge of, your driving lane.

Lane Departure Avoidance operates when driving between 40 and 90 mph (64 and 145 km/h) on roads with clearly visible lane markings. You can choose if and how you want Lane Departure Warning to operate by touching Controls > Autopilot > Lane Departure Avoidance and selecting between these options:
- Off: You are not warned of lane departures or potential collisions with a vehicle in an adjacent lane.
- Warning: If a front wheel passes over a lane marking, the steering wheel vibrates.
- Assist: Corrective steering is applied to keep Model 3 in a safe position if Model 3 drifts into an adjacent lane or near the edge of the road.

When Lane Departure Avoidance is enabled and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is active, if Model 3 drifts out of the driving lane when the associated turn signal is off, Lane Assist also checks to see whether your hands are on the steering wheel. If hands are not detected, the touchscreen displays a series of alerts, similar to those that are used when driving with Autosteer. If hands are repeatedly not detected Model 3 gradually slows down to 15 mph (25 km/h) below the detected speed limit, or below the set cruising speed, and the hazard lights start flashing.

Note: Lane Departure Avoidance does not warn you of lane departures, or provide steering interventions, if the associated turn signal is on, which indicates an intentional lane change.

Warning: Lane Departure Avoidance is intended to help keep you safe, but it does not work in every situation and does not replace the need to remain attentive and in control.

Warning: Keep your hands on the steering wheel and drive attentively at all times.

Warning: Steering interventions are minimal and are not designed to move Model 3 out of its driving lane. Do not rely on steering interventions to avoid side collisions.


## Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance

Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance automatically applies steering to avoid a potential collision in situations where:
- Model 3 is departing a lane and may collide with a vehicle traveling in the same direction in the adjacent lane (regardless of the status of the turn signal).
- Model 3 is departing a lane into an oncoming lane, the turn signal is off, and an oncoming vehicle is detected.
- Model 3 is departing the road and the turn signal is off (for example, very close to the edge of the road and a collision may occur).

To turn this feature on or off, touch Controls > Autopilot > Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance.

When Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance applies steering, a chime sounds and the touchscreen displays a warning and highlights the lane marking in red.

Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance operates when Model 3 is traveling between 40 and 90 mph (64 and 145 km/h) on a road with clearly visible lane markings, curbs, etc.

Warning: Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance is not a substitute for attentive driving and sound judgment. Keep your eyes on the road when driving and never depend on Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance to prevent a collision. Several factors can reduce or impair performance. Depending on Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance to prevent a potential collision can result in serious injury or death.


## Blind Spot Assist

### Automatic Blind Spot Camera

To display the image from the corresponding side repeater camera whenever you engage a turn signal to change lanes, touch Controls > Autopilot > Automatic Blind Spot Camera.

When the turn signal is engaged and the touchscreen is displaying the image from the side repeater camera, you can move the image to a different location on the touchscreen. To do so, touch and drag the image to the new location (valid locations are indicated by shaded areas that display when you touch and hold the image).

Warning: Automatic Blind Spot Camera does not eliminate the need to drive attentively and manually perform shoulder checks when changing lanes.


## Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime

If you want a chime to sound when a vehicle is in your blind spot and a possible collision is detected, touch Controls > Autopilot > Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime.

Warning: Blind Spot Camera does not eliminate the need to drive attentively and manually perform shoulder checks when changing lanes.

Warning: Blind Spot Collision Warning Chime cannot detect every collision. It is the driver's responsibility to remain alert and perform the appropriate shoulder checks when changing lanes.


## Limitations and Inaccuracies

Lane Assist features cannot always detect lane markings and you may experience unnecessary or invalid warnings in these situations:
- Visibility is poor and lane markings are not clearly visible (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
- Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
- A vehicle in front of Model 3 is blocking the view of the camera(s).
- The windshield is obstructing the view of the camera(s) (fogged over, dirty, covered by a sticker, etc.).
- Lane markings are excessively worn, have visible previous markings, have been adjusted due to road construction, or are changing quickly (for example, lanes branching off, crossing over, or merging).
- The road is narrow or winding.
- Objects or landscape features are casting strong shadows on lane markers.

Lane Assist may not provide warnings, or may apply inappropriate warnings, in these situations:
- One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or cameras is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (by mud, ice, or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coatings, etc.).
- Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering with sensor operation.
- The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other electrical equipment or devices that generate ultrasonic waves.
- An object that is mounted to Model 3 is interfering with and/or obstructing a sensor (such as a bike rack or a bumper sticker).

In addition, Lane Assist may not steer Model 3 away from an adjacent vehicle, or may apply unnecessary or inappropriate steering, in these situations:
- You are driving Model 3 on sharp corners or on a curve at a relatively high speed.
- Bright light (such as from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s).
- You are drifting into another lane but an object (such as a vehicle) is not present.
- A vehicle in another lane cuts in front of you or drifts into your driving lane.
- Model 3 is not traveling within the speeds at which the Lane Assist feature is designed to operate.
- One or more of the sensors (if equipped) is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.).
- Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, fog, or extremely hot or cold temperatures) are interfering with sensor operation.
- The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other electrical equipment or devices that generate ultrasonic waves.
- An object mounted to Model 3 (such as a bike rack or a bumper sticker) is interfering with or obstructing a sensor.
- Visibility is poor and lane markings are not clearly visible (due to heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.).
- Lane markings are excessively worn, have visible previous markings, have been adjusted due to road construction or are changing quickly (for example, lanes branching off, crossing over, or merging).

Warning: The lists above do not represent every possible situation that may interfere with Lane Assist features. There are many reasons why Lane Assist may not operate as intended. To avoid a collision, stay alert and always pay attention to the road so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible.
