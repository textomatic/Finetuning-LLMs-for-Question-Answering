# Park Assist

## How Park Assist Works

This feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until it is enabled with a future software update for vehicles manufactured as of approximately October 2022.

Model 3 is designed to detect the presence of objects. When driving slowly in Drive or Reverse (for example, when parking), the vehicle alerts you if an object is detected in close proximity of your Model 3. Objects are only detected in your chosen direction; front objects in Drive, rear objects in Reverse.

Warning: You may not be alerted if Model 3 rolls freely in the opposite direction (for example, Park Assist does not display an alert if Model 3 rolls backwards down a hill while in Drive).

Park Assist is activated when driving slower than 5 mph (8 km/h).

Warning: Never depend on Park Assist to inform you if an area you are approaching is free of objects and/or people. Several external factors can reduce the performance of Park Assist, causing either no readings or false readings (see Limitations and False Warnings). Therefore, depending on Park Assist to determine if Model 3 is approaching an obstruction can result in damage to the vehicle and/or objects, and can potentially cause serious injury. Always inspect the area with your own eyes. When reversing, perform shoulder checks and use all mirrors. Park assist does not detect children, pedestrians, bicyclists, animals, or objects that are moving, protruding, located too far above or below the sensors (if equipped) or cameras, or too close or too far from the sensors or cameras. Park Assist is for guidance purposes only and is not intended to replace your own direct visual checks. It is not a substitute for careful driving.


## Visual and Audio Feedback

When you shift to Reverse, the Park Assist view displays on the touchscreen, showing objects that are in close proximity to the front and rear of Model 3. This view closes when you shift into Drive unless an object is detected close to the front of Model 3, in which case the Park Assist view closes automatically when your driving speed exceeds 5 mph (8 km/h). When reversing, visual feedback also displays on the touchscreen (see Rear Facing Camera(s)). You can manually close the park assist view on the touchscreen by touching the X.

When driving with the Camera app displayed on the touchscreen, you can switch to the Park Assist view when driving at speeds below 5 mph (8 km/h). Touch the button located in the upper left corner of the Camera app screen. This is useful if you need assistance with parallel parking.

If chimes are turned on (see Controlling Audible Feedback), an audible beep sounds as you approach an object.

Note: If Park Assist is unable to provide feedback, the touchscreen displays an alert message.

CAUTION: Keep sensors (if equipped) and cameras clean from dirt, debris, snow, and ice. Avoid using a high pressure power washer on the sensors and cameras, and do not clean a sensor or camera with a sharp or abrasive object that can scratch or damage its surface.

CAUTION: Do not install accessories or stickers on or near the sensors (if equipped) or cameras.


## Controlling Audible Feedback

You can use Park Assist with or without audible feedback. To turn chimes on or off, touch Controls > Safety > Park Assist Chimes.


## Limitations and False Warnings

Park Assist may not function correctly in these situations:
- One or more of the sensors (if equipped) or cameras is damaged, dirty, or obstructed (such as by mud, ice, or snow, or by a vehicle bra, excessive paint, or adhesive products such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.).
- The object is located below approximately 8 inches (20 cm) (such as a curb or low barrier).
CAUTION: Shorter objects that are detected (such as curbs or low barriers) can move into a blind spot. Model 3 cannot alert you about an object while it is in a blind spot.
- Weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, or fog).
- The object is thin (such as a sign post).
- Park Assistâ€™s operating range has been exceeded.
- The object is sound-absorbing or soft (such as powder snow).
- The object is sloped (such as a sloped embankment).
- Model 3 has been parked in, or being driven in, extremely hot or cold temperatures.
- The sensors (if equipped) are affected by other electrical equipment or devices that generate ultrasonic waves.
- You are driving in a location where the sensors' (if equipped) waves are deflected away from the vehicle (such as driving next to a wall or pillar).
- The object is located too close to the bumper.
- A bumper is misaligned or damaged.
- An object that is mounted to Model 3 is interfering with and/or obstructing Park Assist (such as a bike rack or bumper sticker).
- Model 3 rolls freely in the opposite direction you selected (for example, Park Assist does not display an alert if Model 3 rolls backwards down a hill while in Drive).


## Other Parking Aids

In addition to Park Assist, when shifted into Reverse, the backup camera displays a view of the area behind Model 3 (see Rear Facing Camera(s)).
