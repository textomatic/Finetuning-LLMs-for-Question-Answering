# Installing Paint Protection Film Kit

Perform the following to install the Paint Protection Film Kit:
CAUTION: Install the Paint Protection Film Kit when it is dry and warm outside. After installation, do not wash the vehicle and avoid rain for at least 24 hours.
1. Clean the installation area with automotive soap and water, and then dry with a clean microfiber towel. Make sure all dirt, grease, etc. is removed.
2. Create a slip solution by mixing approximately 85% water and 15% baby shampoo in a spray bottle or suitable container. Shake the container to make sure the solution is thoroughly mixed.
3. Apply liberal amounts of the slip solution to the installation area and the LH lower and LH upper film pieces.
4. Release the LH lower film from the backing, applying slip solution as it is released.
CAUTION: The LH and RH film pieces are not interchangeable; the sticky backing should be applied to the paint of the car and follow the contour of the body.
5. Adhere the LH lower film to the rocker panel, aligning the bottom of the sticker with the bottom of the rocker panel and the rear of the sticker with the rear quarter panel of the vehicle.
Note: Apply slip solution as necessary to maneuver the film so that it is aligned with the contours of the body and the entire film is adhered to the paint.
CAUTION: Do not allow any portion of the film to hang off the edge of the vehicle. Avoid adhering the film on the body line between the rocker panel and quarter panel (dog leg).
6. Once the film is correctly positioned, use the squeegee to remove any air bubbles between the film and paint.
7. Release the LH upper film from the backing, applying slip solution as it is released.
8. Adhere the LH upper film to the quarter panel, aligning the bottom of the sticker with the top of the LH lower sticker and the rear of the sticker with the rear quarter panel of the vehicle.
Note: Apply slip solution as necessary to maneuver the film so that it is aligned with the contours of the body and the entire film is adhered to the paint.
9. Once the film is correctly positioned, use the squeegee to remove any air bubbles between the film and paint.
10. Perform steps 3-9 on the RH side.
