# Starting and Powering Off

## Starting

When you open a door to enter Model 3, the touchscreen powers on and you can operate all controls. To drive Model 3:
1. Press the brake pedal - Model 3 powers on and is ready to drive.
2. Select a drive mode - move the drive stalk down for Drive or up for Reverse (see Shifting).

Note: If the PIN to Drive feature is enabled (see PIN to Drive), you must also enter a valid PIN on the touchscreen before you can drive Model 3.

Everything you need to know when driving Model 3 displays on the touchscreen.


## Drive Disabled - Requires Authentication

If Model 3 does not detect a key when you press the brake (a key fob or phone key is not detected or two minutes have passed since you used the key card), the touchscreen displays a message telling you that driving requires authentication.

If you see this message, place the key card behind the cup holders where the RFID transmitter can read it. The two-minute authentication period restarts and you can start Model 3 by pressing the brake pedal.

A number of factors can affect whether Model 3 can detect a phone key or key fob (for example, the device's battery is low or dead and is no longer able to communicate using Bluetooth).

Always keep your phone key, key fob, or a key card with you. After driving, your key is needed to restart Model 3 after it powers off. And when you leave Model 3, you must bring your key with you to lock Model 3, either manually or automatically.


## Powering Off

When you finish driving, shift into Park by pressing the button on the end of the drive stalk. When you leave Model 3 with your phone key and key fob, it powers off automatically, turning off the touchscreen.

Model 3 also powers off automatically after being in Park for 30 minutes, even if you are sitting in the driver’s seat.

Although usually not needed, you can power off Model 3 while sitting in the driver’s seat, provided the vehicle is not moving. Touch Controls > Safety > Power Off. Model 3 automatically powers back on again if you press the brake pedal or touch the touchscreen.

Note: Model 3 automatically shifts into Park whenever it determines that you are exiting the vehicle (for example, the driver's seat belt is unbuckled and the vehicle is almost at a standstill). If you shift into Neutral, Model 3 shifts into Park when you open the door to exit. To keep Model 3 in Neutral, you will need to activate Transport Mode (see Instructions for Transporters).


## Power Cycling the Vehicle

You can power cycle Model 3 if it demonstrates unusual behavior or displays a nondescript alert.

Note: If the touchscreen is unresponsive or demonstrates unusual behavior, reboot it before you power cycle the vehicle (see Restarting the Touchscreen).

1. Shift into Park.
2. On the touchscreen, touch Controls > Safety > Power Off.
3. Wait for at least two minutes without interacting with the vehicle. Do not open the doors, touch the brake pedal, touch the touchscreen, etc.
4. After two minutes, press the brake pedal or open the door to wake the vehicle.
