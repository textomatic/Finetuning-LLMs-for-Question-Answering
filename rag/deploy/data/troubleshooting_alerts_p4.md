## Alert: VCSEC_a221
Air pressure below recommendation for tires
Check pressure and refill air as needed

What this alert means:
This alert does NOT indicate that there is a flat tire.
The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) has detected that the air pressure in one or more of your tires is at least 20% lower than the recommended cold tire pressure.
See Maintaining Tire Pressures for detailed information on where to find the recommended cold pressure (RCP) for your vehicle's tires, how to check tire pressures, and how to keep your tires properly inflated.
This alert may appear in cold weather because the air in your tires naturally contracts when it becomes cold, decreasing tire pressures.

What to do:
Add air to maintain the recommended cold tire pressure. Although drops in tire pressure are expected in colder weather, the recommended cold tire pressure should be maintained at all times.
The alert may clear as the vehicle is driven. This is because the tires will warm up and the tire pressure will increase. Even if the alert clears, the tires should still be refilled with air once they have cooled.
The alert will clear once the Tire Pressure Monitoring System detects that each of your tires is inflated to the recommended cold pressure.
- The alert and Tire Pressure indicator light may still be present immediately after you have filled your tires to the recommended cold pressure, but both should clear once you have driven a short distance.
- You may need to drive over 15 mph (25 km/h) for at least 10 minutes for the Tire Pressure Monitoring System to measure and report your updated tire pressures.
If you repeatedly see this alert for the same tire, have the tire inspected for a slow leak. You can visit a local tire shop or schedule service using your Tesla Mobile App.
For more information on tire pressure and inflation, see Tire Care and Maintenance.


## Alert: VCSEC_a228
