# Unlocking and Starting Using Mobile App

You can use your mobile app to unlock and start Model 3. This may be useful in cases where you do not have your key card or key fob, are experiencing issues with phone key, or are not physically close to the vehicle (for example, you want to unlock the vehicle for your spouse from across town).

Note: Your phone and vehicle must both be actively connected to cellular service and mobile access must be enabled on the touchscreen (Controls > Safety & Security > Allow Mobile Access) to allow the mobile app to communicate with your vehicle. Tesla recommends that you always have a functional physical key readily available if parking in an area with limited or absent cellular service, such as an indoor parking garage.

To unlock your vehicle using the mobile app:
1. Open the mobile app on your phone.
2. Touch Controls > Unlock.
3. Touch Yes on the confirmation popup window.

To start your vehicle using the mobile app:
1. Open the mobile app on your phone.
2. Touch Controls > Start.
3. Enter your Tesla account password on the confirmation popup window.

Note: You will have two minutes to start driving after enabling keyless driving. If the two-minute window has expired prior to driving you will need to re-enable keyless driving.
