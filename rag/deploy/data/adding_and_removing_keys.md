# Adding and Removing Keys

To add a new key:

Note: When adding a key fob, ensure it is at room temperature. Pairing a key fob that is very cold can be unsuccessful.

1. On the touchscreen, touch Controls > Locks > Keys > Add Key.
2. Scan your new key card or key fob on the card reader located behind the cup holders on the top of the center console. After the new key card or key fob is recognized, remove it from the card reader.
3. Scan a key card or key fob that has already been paired to the vehicle to confirm new key pairing.
4. When complete, the key list includes the new key. Touch the associated pencil icon to customize the name of the key.

Removing a key:
When you no longer want a key to access Model 3 (for example, you lost your phone or key card, etc.), follow these steps to remove it.
1. On the touchscreen, touch Controls > Locks.
2. In the key list, find the key that you would like to delete and touch its associated trash icon.
3. When prompted, scan an authenticated key on the card reader to confirm the deletion. When complete, the key list no longer includes the deleted key.
Note
Model 3 requires at least one authenticated key card or key fob at all times. If only one key card remains on the key list, you cannot delete it.
