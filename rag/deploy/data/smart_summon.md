# Smart Summon

This feature may be temporarily limited or inactive until it is enabled with a future software update for vehicles manufactured as of approximately October 2022.

Note: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Smart Summon, or the feature may not operate exactly as described.

Smart Summon is designed to allow you to move Model 3 to your location (using your phone's GPS as a target destination) or to a location of your choice, maneuvering around and stopping for objects as necessary. Smart Summon works with the Tesla mobile app when your phone is located within approximately 213 ft. (65 meters) of Model 3.

Smart Summon maneuvers Model 3 out of parking spaces and around corners. This is useful for moving Model 3 out of a tight parking spot, through puddles, or helping you retrieve your car while carrying packages. You must maintain a clear line of sight between you and Model 3 and closely monitor the vehicle and its surroundings at all times.

CAUTION: Smart Summon is designed and intended for use only on parking lots and driveways located on private property where the surrounding area is familiar and predictable. Do not use Smart Summon on public roads.

Warning: Smart Summon must only be used on paved surfaces.

Warning: Smart Summon is a BETA feature. You must continually monitor the vehicle and its surroundings and stay prepared to take immediate action at any time. It is the driver's responsibility to use Smart Summon safely, responsibly, and as intended. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Smart Summon (see Limitations and Warnings).


## Before Using Smart Summon

- Download the latest version of the Tesla mobile app to your phone, and ensure your phone has cellular service and GPS enabled.
- Your phone must be connected to Model 3 and located within approximately 213 ft. (65 meters).
- The vehicle's cameras must be fully calibrated (see Drive to Calibrate Cameras).
- You must have a clear line of sight to Model 3.
- Model 3 must be in Park, not charging, and all doors and trunks must be closed.

CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance.


## Using Smart Summon

1. Open the Tesla mobile app, and press Summon.
2. Press the Smart Summon icon located in the center of the image of your Model 3. It may take several seconds for Smart Summon to start up.
Note: You can use Standby Mode to eliminate the delay that occurs when Smart Summon is starting up (see Standby Mode).
The mobile app displays a map with a blue circle, which represents the maximum proximity of 213 ft. (65 meters) that you must maintain between your phone and Model 3. The blue dot on the map represents your location, and the red arrow represents the vehicle.
3. Position yourself anywhere within the blue circle where you have a clear line of sight to Model 3.
4. You can now operate Smart Summon using either of these modes:
- Come to Me mode: Press and hold the Come to Me button. Model 3 moves to your GPS location. As you move, Model 3 follows you. When Model 3 reaches you, it stops and shifts into park.
- Go to Target mode: Touch the crosshair icon then drag the map to position the pin on a chosen destination. Press and hold the Go to Target button. Model 3 moves to the destination. When reaching the location, Model 3 stops and shifts into Park and the mobile app displays a message indicating that Summon has completed.
Note: To subsequently change the location, lift your finger, reposition the map, then press and hold Go to Target again.
To stop Model 3 at any time, simply release the Come to Me or Go to Target button.

The map's crosshair icon toggles between Go to Target and Come to Me modes. When Come to Me mode is selected, the icon is blue.
Note: The map also has an icon that allows you to display/hide satellite imagery.

Immediately after initiating Smart Summon in either mode, hazard lights briefly flash, mirrors fold, and Model 3 shifts into Drive or Reverse. Model 3 then slowly moves to within 3 ft. (1 meter) of you (Come to Me) or your chosen destination (Go to Target), navigating obstacles as needed. As Model 3 moves, the corresponding red arrow on the map also moves to show the vehicle’s location. As you move, the corresponding blue dot also moves to show your location.

In either mode, Model 3 stops moving and shifts into park when:
- You release the button on the mobile app.
- The maximum proximity between your phone and Model 3 is exceeded (if moving the vehicle to a destination away from you, you may need to follow the car to maintain this distance).
- The driving path is blocked.
- Model 3 has moved the maximum distance of 475 ft. (145 meters) since the start of the Smart Summon session, or has moved 492 ft. (150 meters) away from the location from which the vehicle was last driven manually.
Note: If Smart Summon moves Model 3 forward 3 ft. and then backwards 2 ft., this is considered 5 ft. of travel.

Note: There is no need to look at the mobile app—just hold down the button while keeping your eye on Model 3 and its driving path at all times, remaining ready to release the button to stop the vehicle if needed.

If equipped and Auto HomeLink is enabled for Summon (touch Controls > Autopilot > Customize Summon > Use Auto HomeLink), Smart Summon automatically opens a HomeLink device if you start the Smart Summon maneuver when Model 3 is located inside a garage. The mobile app informs you that the door has opened.

Warning: When you release the button to stop Model 3, a slight delay occurs before the vehicle stops. Therefore, it is critical that you pay close attention to the vehicle’s driving path at all times and proactively anticipate obstacles that the vehicle may be unable to detect.

Warning: Use extreme caution when using Smart Summon in environments where movement of obstacles can be unpredictable. For example, where people, children or animals are present.

Warning: Smart Summon may not stop for all objects (especially very low objects such as some curbs, or very high objects such as a shelf) and may not react to all oncoming or side traffic. Pay attention and be ready to stop Model 3 at all times by releasing the button on the mobile app.


## Standby Mode

To keep Model 3 ready to Summon and reduce the time it takes to warm up, turn on Standby Mode. Touch Controls > Autopilot > Standby Mode. When Standby Mode is turned on, you can conserve Battery energy by disabling Standby Mode at these locations:
- Exclude Home - Disables Standby Mode at the location you set as Home in your Favorites list.
- Exclude Work - Disables Standby Mode at the location you set as Work in your Favorites list.
- Exclude Favorites - Disables Standby Mode at any location in your Favorites list.

Note: To conserve energy, Smart Summon automatically exits Standby mode from midnight to 6:00 am. During these hours, a delay occurs as Smart Summon starts up.

Note: Additional battery power may be consumed while Standby Mode is active.

Note: For details on how to designate a location as Home, Work, or Favorites, see Home, Work, and Favorite Destinations.


## Stopping or Canceling Smart Summon

Smart Summon stops Model 3 whenever you release the button on the mobile app. To resume the Smart Summon session, simply press the Come to Me or Go to Target button again.

Warning: Always anticipate when you need to stop Model 3. Depending on the quality of the connectivity between the phone and Model 3, there may be a slight delay between when you release the button and when the car stops.

Smart Summon cancels, and requires you to restart it, when:
- A door handle is engaged or a door is opened.
- You interact with the steering wheel, brake pedal, accelerator pedal, or shift.
- Model 3 is blocked by an obstacle.
- Smart Summon has moved Model 3 the maximum distance. To move further than this distance, you must shift Model 3 into Drive or Reverse and then re-initiate a Smart Summon session.
- Your phone enters sleep mode or loses connectivity to Model 3.
