# Running Out of Range

Note: In the unlikely event your vehicle runs out of range while driving, pull over when safe to do so and contact Tesla Roadside Assistance or your preferred tow provider.

If Model 3 runs out of range, the low voltage battery is no longer supported â€“ and when low voltage is not supported, the vehicle cannot charge. Therefore, the low voltage battery must be supported by an external power supply to allow you to charge the high voltage (HV) Battery. Once the vehicle begins charging, the external power supply is no longer required.

In the case of running out of range away from a charger, the tow provider should transport Model 3 to the nearest charging station and unload the vehicle within the charging cable's reach. Once the vehicle is positioned next to a charger, follow these instructions:

Note: If the vehicle is being transported to a charger, make sure the tow provider does not leave until confirming that the vehicle's high voltage Battery is successfully charging.

1. Jump start the low voltage battery (see Jump Starting). The low voltage battery must be jump started to support the high voltage Battery.
2. Wait a few minutes. Once the touchscreen powers on, plug the charge cable into Model 3 to begin charging the high voltage Battery.
3. When Model 3 begins to charge, disconnect the external power supply from the low voltage battery.

Before transporting to a non-Tesla charger, ensure your vehicle is equipped with an adapter that accommodates the specific type of charging station you will be using. Even at a non-Tesla charger, you will need to jump start the low voltage battery before you can begin charging.

CAUTION: Always ensure Model 3 has enough range for your drive, or for being stored for an extended period. Do not rely on the range estimates displayed on the touchscreen or mobile app as range can decrease faster than projected due to ambient temperature, driving habits, wind, vehicle settings (such as Sentry Mode), etc.

Note: Towing your vehicle as a result of running out of range is not covered by the warranty.
