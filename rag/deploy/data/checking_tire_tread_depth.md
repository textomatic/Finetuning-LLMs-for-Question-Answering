# Checking Tire Tread Depth

Measuring your tread depth is important to safety, proper performance, and determining if a tire rotation (if applicable) is due. Tires with a tread depth less than 4/32” (3 mm) are more likely to hydroplane in wet conditions and should not be used. Tires with a tread depth less than 5/32” (4 mm) do not perform well in snow and slush and should not be used when driving in winter conditions.

To improve vehicle handling characteristics and minimize hydroplaning in wet conditions, put tires with the most tread on the rear of the car.

Use the table as a general guideline when measuring the tread depth.
|Tread Depth|Condition|
|------|------|
|5/32” or deeper|Tires are good|
|3/32” – 4/32”|Replace or rotate tires soon; tire performance may be compromised in wet or snowy conditions|
|2/32” or less|Replace or rotate tires now|


## Using a Tread Depth Gauge

Use a tread depth gauge to accurately measure your tires on the outside, middle, and inside of the tire. To measure, extend the tire tread wear indicator into one of the main tread grooves. If the tread depth gauge reads 2/32” or less on any of the three measurements, Tesla recommends replacing the tires now.
