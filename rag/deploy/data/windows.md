# Windows

## Opening and Closing

Note: It is your responsibility to ensure windows are closed after locking the vehicle.

Press down on a switch to lower the associated window. Window switches operate at two levels:
- To lower a window fully, press the switch all the way down and immediately release.
- To lower a window partially, press the switch gently and release when the window is where you want it.

Similarly, pull a switch to raise the associated window:
- To raise a window fully, pull the switch all the way up and immediately release.
- To raise a window partially, pull the switch gently and release when the window is where you want it.

If a window is left open unintentionally, Model 3 can send a notification to the mobile app (touch Controls > Locks > Car Left Open Notification, then choose Doors & Windows).

You can also enable Close Windows on Lock by touching Controls > Locks > Close Windows on Lock. When enabled, your vehicle automatically closes the windows when Model 3 locks.

Note: See Cold Weather Best Practices for information on preparing windows for cold weather.

CAUTION: To avoid damage, windows automatically lower slightly when you open or close a door. If you manually raise a window when the door is open, ensure it is slightly lowered before closing the door.

Warning: Before closing a window, it is the driver’s responsibility to ensure that all occupants, especially children, do not have any body parts extended through the window’s opening. Failure to do so can cause serious injury.


## Locking Rear Windows

To prevent passengers from using the rear window switches, touch Controls > Locks > Window Lock. To unlock the rear windows, touch Window Lock again.

Warning: To ensure safety, it is recommended that you lock the rear window switches whenever children are seated in the rear seats.

Warning: Never leave children unattended in Model 3.


## Calibrating Windows

In the unlikely event that a window behaves unexpectedly (touches the bright molding, fails to open or close properly, goes down more than normal when the door opens, etc.), you can calibrate it to potentially fix the issue.

To calibrate a window:
1. Close the door with the affected window.
2. Sit in the driver's seat and close the driver door.
3. Using the window's switch on the driver's door, raise the affected window until it stalls.
4. Using the window's switch on the driver's door, lower the affected window until it stalls.
5. Repeat step 3 and raise the affected window until it stalls.

The window should now be calibrated. If the issue continues after attempting the calibration procedure a couple times, contact Tesla.


## UV Index Rating

The roof, windshields, and windows in Model 3 are excellent at protecting you from UV (ultraviolet) rays. The glass components score less than 2 on the UV Index scale. Review your region’s UV Index specifications for more information. You are still responsible for taking the necessary precautions for sun protection.
