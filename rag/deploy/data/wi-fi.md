# Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is available as a data connection method and is often faster than cellular data networks. Connecting to Wi-Fi is especially useful in areas with limited or no cellular connectivity. To ensure fast, reliable delivery of software and map updates, Tesla recommends leaving Model 3 connected to a Wi-Fi network whenever possible (for example, when parked overnight).

To connect to a Wi-Fi network:
1. Touch Controls > Wi-Fi icon at the top of the Controls screen. Model 3 begins to scan and display detected Wi-Fi networks that are within range.
When connected to Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi icon displays at the top of the touchscreen.
Note: If a known Wi-Fi network does not appear in the list, move Model 3 closer to the access point or consider using a range extender.
Note: When connecting to a 5GHz network (if available), check which channels are supported in your region. 5GHz Network Channels Supported: 36-48, 52-64, 100-140, 149-165.
2. Select the Wi-Fi network you want to use, enter the password (if necessary), then touch Confirm.
Note: Model 3 does not currently support connections to captive Wi-Fi networks (a captive Wi-Fi, commonly used by public hotspots, requires you to access a custom web portal and agree to terms of service prior to allowing you to log in).
3. Model 3 connects to the Wi-Fi network. Whenever the network is within range, Model 3 connects to it automatically.

You can also connect to a hidden network that isn't shown on the list of scanned networks. Just touch Wi-Fi Settings, enter the name of the network in the resulting dialog box, select the security setting, then touch Add Network.

Note: If more than one previously connected network is within range, Model 3 connects to the one most recently used.

Note: At Tesla Service Centers, Model 3 automatically connects to the Tesla Service Wi-Fi network.


## Hotspots and Connectivity

You can also use a mobile hotspot or your phone's Internet connection via Wi-Fi tethering (subject to fees and restrictions of your mobile carrier) to access the internet. To remain connected to Wi-Fi when shifting into Drive or Reverse, choose the connection from the Wi-Fi settings screen, then touch Remain connected in Drive.
