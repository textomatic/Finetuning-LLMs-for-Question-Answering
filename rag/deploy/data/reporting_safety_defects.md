# Reporting Safety Defects

## Contacting Tesla

For detailed information about your Model 3, go to http://www.tesla.com and log on to your Tesla account or sign up to get an account.

If you have any questions or concerns about your Model 3, in the United States, Canada or Puerto Rico, call 1-877-79TESLA (1-877â€‘798-3752) and in Mexico, call 1-800-228-8145.

Note: You can also use voice commands to provide feedback to Tesla. Say "Report", "Feedback", or "Bug report" followed by brief comments. Model 3 takes a snapshot of its systems, including your current location, vehicle diagnostic data, and screen captures of the touchscreen. Tesla periodically reviews these notes and uses them to continue improving Model 3.


## Reporting Safety Defects - US

If you believe that Model 3 has a defect which could cause a crash or could cause injury or death, you should immediately inform the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in addition to notifying Tesla.

If NHTSA receives similar complaints, it may open an investigation. If it finds that a safety defect exists in a group of vehicles, it may order a recall and remedy campaign. However, NHTSA cannot become involved in individual problems between you, your dealer, or Tesla.

To contact NHTSA, you may call the Vehicle Safety Hotline toll-free at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY: 1-800-424-9153); go to www.safercar.gov; or write to: Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590. You can also obtain other information about motor vehicle safety from www.safercar.gov.
