# Safety & Security Settings

## About the Security System

If Model 3 does not detect an authenticated phone or key and a locked door or trunk is opened, an alarm sounds. The headlights and turn signals also flash. To deactivate the alarm, press any button on the mobile app or tap your key card or key fob against the card reader located just below the Autopilot camera on the driver's side door pillar.

To manually enable or disable the alarm system, touch Controls > Safety > Security Alarm. When enabled, Model 3 activates its alarm one minute after you exit, the doors lock, and a recognized key is no longer detected.

A battery-backed siren (if equipped) sounds in situations where a locked door or trunk is opened and Model 3 does not detect a key nearby. If you also want this siren to sound in situations where the vehicle detects motion inside the cabin, enable Tilt/Intrusion (see Tilt/Intrusion (if equipped)).

Note: If Model 3 is in Sentry Mode (see How to Use Sentry Mode (Camera + App)), the Security Alarm setting is not available.


## Tilt/Intrusion (if equipped)

Depending on configuration, market region, and date of manufacture, your vehicle may not be equipped with this feature.

The Security Alarm must be on to enable Tilt/Intrusion.

Tilt/Intrusion sounds the alarm in your vehicle if Model 3 detects motion inside the cabin, or is moved or tilted (for example, with a tow truck or jack). To enable, touch Controls > Safety > Tilt/Intrusion.

The intrusion sensor automatically disables in situations where the climate control system is operating when you leave your vehicle. To override, you can manually turn the Tilt/Intrusion Sensor on again after choosing Keep Climate On, Dog, or Camp Mode.

The tilt/intrusion sensor automatically re-enables at the start of every drive cycle.

Note: The Tilt/Intrusion alarm must be turned off to use Cabin Overheat Protection (see Cabin Overheat Protection).

Note: If you plan to leave something that moves inside your locked vehicle, remember to turn off Tilt/Intrusion. If this setting is on, any motion detected inside Model 3 activates the intrusion alarm.

Note: If Model 3 is in Sentry Mode (see How to Use Sentry Mode (Camera + App)), the Tilt/Intrusion setting is not available.


## PIN to Drive

To increase security, you can prevent Model 3 from being driven until a 4-digit PIN (Personal Identification Number) is entered. To enable this setting, touch Controls > Safety > PIN to Drive and follow the on-screen prompts to create a driving PIN.

When enabled, in addition to entering the 4-digit driving PIN to drive, you must also use it to enter Valet mode for the first time and create the 4-digit valet PIN to enter and exit Valet mode. In Valet mode, Model 3 can be driven without the need for the valet to enter a driving PIN. The PIN to Drive setting is disabled whenever Valet mode is active.

If you forget your driving PIN, touch the link to enter your Tesla login credentials on the PIN to Drive popup, then follow the on-screen prompts.

Note: In the unlikely event that your touchscreen is unresponsive, you may be unable to enter the PIN. In this case, first try to restart the touchscreen (see Restarting the Touchscreen). If the touchscreen is still unresponsive, you can still bypass PIN to Drive by turning on Keyless Driving in the Tesla mobile app.


## Glovebox PIN

For additional security, you can protect the contents in your glovebox with a 4-digit PIN. To enable this setting, touch Controls > Safety > Glovebox PIN and follow the on-screen prompts. When enabled, you are prompted to enter the PIN to open the glovebox. To disable this setting, select the toggle to disable and then enter the PIN.

If you forget your glovebox PIN, reset it by entering your Tesla login credentials, then follow the on-screen prompts.

Note: Using a Glovebox PIN allows the glovebox to be opened even when Model 3 is in Valet mode.


## Speed Limit Mode

Speed Limit Mode allows you to limit acceleration and limit the maximum driving speed to a chosen value between 50 and 120 mph (80 and 193 km/h). The first time you use this feature, you must create a 4-digit PIN that you must use to enable and disable Speed Limit Mode. When enabled and the driving speed approaches within approximately 3 mph (5 km/h) of the maximum speed, a chime sounds, the touchscreen displays a message, and Model 3 sends a notification to the mobile app. You can also touch Security > Speed Limit Mode to enable from the Tesla mobile app. To enable Speed Limit Mode:
1. Ensure Model 3 is in Park.
2. Touch Controls > Safety > Speed Limit Mode on the touchscreen.
3. Select the maximum driving speed.
4. Drag the slider to the On position.
5. Enter the 4-digit PIN that you want to use to enable and disable Speed Limit Mode.

Note: If you forget the PIN, you can disable Speed Limit Mode by entering login credentials for your Tesla account.

Note: While Speed Limit Mode is enabled, the acceleration setting (Controls > Pedals & Steering > Acceleration) automatically sets to Chill.

Warning: Driving downhill can increase driving speed and cause Model 3 to exceed your chosen maximum speed.

Warning: Speed Limit Mode is not a replacement for good judgment, driver training, and the need to closely monitor speed limits and driving conditions. Accidents occur at any speed.


## Clear Browser Data

You can clear your vehicle's browser data (like you would on a computer or smartphone) by navigating to Controls > Service > Clear Browser Data. This is useful for many situations, such erasing settings or searches from another driver.

Check the boxes on the touchscreen popup to exclude bookmarks and/or history for your convenience.
