# Dashcam

Note: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Dashcam or the features may not operate exactly as described. It is your sole responsibility to consult and comply with all local regulations and property restrictions regarding the use of cameras.

Dashcam records video footage of your vehicle's surroundings when driving Model 3. Use Dashcam to record driving incidents or other notable events, like you would for an external dashcam on other vehicles.

The Dashcam icon is located in the app launcher. You can add the Dashcam app to the bottom bar for easy access (see Customizing My Apps). When Model 3 is in Park, touching the Dashcam icon displays the Viewer (see Viewing Video Recordings).

To protect your privacy, video recordings are saved locally to a formatted USB flash drive's onboard memory. Recordings are not sent to Tesla. Model 3 does not record videos when Dashcam is Off.


## How to Use Dashcam

1. Format a USB flash drive. Dashcam requires a properly formatted USB drive inserted in your vehicle's USB port (Tesla recommends using the glovebox USB port, if equipped) to store and retrieve footage. Vehicles manufactured beginning approximately 2020 are equipped with a pre-formatted USB flash drive in the glove box. There are two ways to format the flash drive:
- Insert the flash drive into the USB port and navigate to Controls > Safety > Format USB Drive. Model 3 automatically formats the flash drive for you.
- Format the flash drive on a computer.
See USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos for more information.
2. Insert the USB flash drive into your vehicle's USB port, preferably the one in the glovebox.
Note: For some vehicles manufactured after approximately November 1, 2021, the center console USB ports may only support charging devices. Use the USB port inside the glove box for all other functions.
3. Enable Dashcam by touching Controls > Safety > Dashcam. Dashcam allows you to choose how and when footage is saved. You can choose between:
- Auto: Dashcam automatically saves a recording to the USB drive when Model 3 detects a safety-critical event, such as a collision or airbag deployment. When Auto is selected, detection can vary and is subject to your vehicle's power, sleep, and Autopilot state.
Note: Several factors determine whether Dashcam automatically saves a recording of a safety-critical event (for example, amount of force, whether or not airbags deploy, etc.). Do not rely on Dashcam to automatically record all safety-critical events.
- Manual: You must manually touch the Dashcam icon to save a recording of the most recent ten minutes of footage.
- On Honk: When you press the horn, Dashcam saves a recording of the most recent ten minutes of footage. You can enable this along with Auto or Manual.
4. Once enabled, the Dashcam icon indicates when footage is saved. You can also view the status of the Dashcam icon in Controls: gray camera icon. 
The icon changes to show the status of Dashcam:
RECORDING: Dashcam is recording. To save video footage, touch the icon. To pause recording, press and hold the icon.
PAUSED: Dashcam is paused. To resume recording, touch the icon. To avoid losing video footage, pause Dashcam before removing the flash drive.

SAVED: Footage is saved. You can also save Dashcam clips by touching the Dashcam icon in the app launcher while Driving.
Note: Once saved, Dashcam saves the last 10 minutes of footage.
5. Once your desired footage is saved, view the clips on the touchscreen or a computer:
- Touchscreen: Ensure Model 3 is in Park and touch the Dashcam icon in the app launcher. Videos are organized by timestamp. See Viewing Video Recordings for more information.
- Computer: Insert the USB flash drive into a computer and navigate to the TeslaCam folder. Videos are organized by timestamp. See Viewing Video Recordings for more information.
6. To turn Dashcam off, navigate to Controls > Safety > Dashcam > Off. If set to Auto, Manual, or On Honk, Dashcam automatically enables every time you drive.
