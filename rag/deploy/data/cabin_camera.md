# Cabin Camera

Your Model 3 may be equipped with a cabin camera located above the rear view mirror.

The cabin camera can determine driver inattentiveness and provide you with audible alerts, to remind you to keep your eyes on the road when Autopilot is engaged.

By default, images and video from the camera do not leave the vehicle itself and are not transmitted to anyone, including Tesla, unless you enable data sharing. If you enable data sharing and a safety critical event occurs (such as a collision), Model 3 shares short cabin camera video clips with Tesla to help us develop future safety enhancements and continuously improve the intelligence of features that rely on the cabin camera. Data may also be shared if diagnostics are required on cabin camera functionality. Cabin camera does not perform facial recognition or any other method of identity verification. To protect your privacy, cabin camera data is not associated with your vehicle identification number.

To adjust your data sharing preferences touch Controls > Software > Data Sharing > Allow Cabin Camera Analytics. You can change your data sharing settings at any time.

Note: Keep the camera lens clean and free of obstructions. Remove any buildup of dirt or dust by occasionally wiping the camera lens with a clean cloth.

CAUTION: Do not use chemical-based or abrasive cleaners. Doing so can damage the surface of the camera lens.
