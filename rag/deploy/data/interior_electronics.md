# Interior Electronics

In addition to storage compartments and cup holders (see Interior Storage), the Model 3 interior supports various electronics such as an RFID transmitter that reads key fobs and key cards (see Keys), USB ports, a wireless phone charger, and a 12V power socket.


## USB Ports

Model 3 has two USB ports located in the front compartment of the center console. These ports can be used to:
- Connect and charge USB devices.
- Play audio files stored on a phone or USB device (see Playing Media from Devices).
- For saving Sentry Mode and Dashcam video footage, use the USB port located in the glove box. Doing so increases security and minimizes power consumption.

The USB ports can output power up to approximately 15W (which may vary depending on vehicle manufacture date).

Note: For some vehicles manufactured after approximately November 1, 2021, the center console USB ports may only support charging devices. Use the USB port inside the glove box for all other functions.

Both ports are USB-C compatible.

See USB Drive Requirements for Recording Videos for information about formatting USB flash drives.

Open the front compartment of the center console. The front USB ports are located on the rear wall of the compartment.

Depending on date of manufacture, some vehicles include a USB port located inside the glovebox. This USB-A port is equipped with a pre-formatted flash drive, ready to save videos when using features such as Sentry Mode and Dashcam. Although not its primary purpose, this port can also communicate with the vehicle and can be used to charge a USB-connected device.

Two additional USB ports are located in the rear of the center console (on vehicles manufactured since approximately June 2020, these ports are USB-C). These ports charge USB-connected devices but do not communicate with the vehicle.

Note: Power is available whenever the vehicle is considered "awake". The vehicle may be awake for many reasons. For example, when using features such as Summon, or when features such as Preconditioning, Keep Climate On, Dog Mode, Camp Mode, Sentry Mode, etc. are enabled. The vehicle is also awake whenever the low voltage battery is being charged or is in use, during HV charging, when the vehicle is communicating with the mobile app, etc. Leaving an accessory plugged in does not deplete the low voltage battery.

Note: Use USB 3.0 compliant cables to connect a device to a USB port. Using non-compliant cables can result in slower charging, potential connection problems or degraded performance.

Note: Do not connect multiple devices using a USB hub. This can prevent connected devices from charging or from being recognized by Media Player, Sentry Mode, Dashcam, etc.


## Wireless Phone Charger

A wireless phone charger (if equipped), is integrated into the front console to provide up to 15W of power to charge a Qi-enabled phone. Simply place your phone on the charger. Your device may feel warm while charging, but this is a normal effect of inductive charging.

When placed on the wireless charger, your phone charges whenever the vehicle is powered on (the touchscreen is on and you are inside the vehicle). Your phone will not charge after exiting the vehicle unless a feature (such as Sentry mode) is enabled and providing power to the USB ports. Model 3 will also not charge a phone if the vehicle's Battery is discharged.

Note: The wireless phone charger may not work if your phone case is too large or is made of metal. Try removing the phone from its case before placing in the charger.

CAUTION: The phone must be in direct contact with the wireless charger. Do not place objects between the phone and the charger (for example, credit cards, key cards, coins, keys, metal objects, etc.).


## Low Voltage Power Socket

Your Model 3 has a power socket located in the center console's rear compartment.
The power socket is suitable for accessories requiring up to 12A continuous draw (16A peak).

Note: For vehicles manufactured after approximately November 2021, power inverters plugged into the low voltage power socket must support 16V DC input to function.

Note: Power is available whenever the vehicle is considered "awake". The vehicle may be awake for many reasons. For example, when using features such as Summon, or when features such as Preconditioning, Cabin Overheat Protection, Keep Climate On, Dog Mode, Camp Mode, Sentry Mode, etc. are enabled. The vehicle is also awake whenever the low voltage battery is being charged or is in use, during HV charging, when the vehicle is communicating with the mobile app, etc. Leaving an accessory plugged in does not deplete the low voltage battery.

Warning: The power socket and an accessory’s connector can become hot.

Warning: To prevent excessive interference with the vehicle’s electronics, Tesla recommends that you do not plug any non-Tesla accessories, including power inverters, into the low voltage power socket. However, if you do use a non-Tesla accessory and notice any malfunctions or unexpected behavior, such as indicator lights, alert messages, or excessive heat from the accessory, unplug the accessory from the low voltage power socket immediately.

CAUTION: Do not attempt to jump start Model 3 using the low voltage power socket. Doing so can result in damage.
