# Shifting

## How to Shift

When Model 3 is in Park, you must press the brake pedal to shift.

Move the drive stalk up or down to shift into different drive modes.

If you try to shift when it is prohibited by the current driving speed, a chime sounds and the drive mode does not change.


## Reverse

Push the drive stalk all the way up and release. You can only shift into Reverse when Model 3 is stopped or moving less than 5 mph (8 km/h).


## Neutral

Neutral allows Model 3 to roll freely when you are not pressing the brake pedal:
- When in Park, shift into Neutral by briefly pushing the drive stalk either up or down to the first position.
- When in Drive, shift into Neutral by briefly pushing the drive stalk up to the first position. If Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (if equipped) is active, you must push the drive stalk up to the first position and hold it there for more than 1 second. In doing so, Autosteer or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is disabled.
- When in Reverse, shift into Neutral by briefly pushing the drive stalk down to the first position.

Note: You must press the brake pedal to shift out of Neutral if driving slower than approximately 5 mph (8 km/h).

Model 3 automatically shifts into Park when you leave the driver's seat. To stay in Neutral, use the touchscreen to engage Transport Mode (see Instructions for Transporters).


## Drive

Push the drive stalk all the way down and release. You can shift into Drive when Model 3 is stopped or moving less than 5 mph (8 km/h) in Reverse.

Note: When in Drive, push the drive stalk all the way down and release to enable cruise control and push the stalk down twice in quick succession to enable Autosteer (see Autopilot Features).


## Park

Press the end of the drive stalk while Model 3 is stopped.

Model 3 automatically shifts into Park whenever you connect a charge cable or if two or more of the following conditions are met simultaneously while traveling slower than approximately 1.5 mph (2 km/h):
- The driver's seat belt is unbuckled.
- The occupancy sensor in the driver's seat does not detect an occupant.
- The driver's door is opened.

Attempting to engage the parking brake above 5 mph (8 km/h) will result in emergency braking (see Emergency Braking).

To make it convenient to pick up passengers, you can also unlock all doors at any time by shifting into Park then pressing the Park button a second time.

Note: You must press the brake pedal to shift out of Park.

Note: The above conditions do not reflect a comprehensive list of reasons why Model 3 may or may not automatically shift into Park and, in certain scenarios, it is possible for your vehicle to shift into Park when only one of the above conditions is true.

CAUTION: In emergency situations, if the brakes are not functioning properly, press and hold the Park button on the drive stalk to bring Model 3 to a stop. Do not use this method to stop the vehicle unless absolutely necessary.

Warning: It is the driver's responsibility to always ensure the vehicle is in Park before exiting. Never rely on Model 3 to automatically shift into Park for you; it might not work in all circumstances (for example, if Creep or a slope causes the vehicle to travel greater than approximately 1.5 mph (2 km/h)).
